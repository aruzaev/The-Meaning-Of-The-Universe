# [[Paradigms Lost]]

The biggest crisis in science today is ***legitimacy*** based on increasing public distrust of science

There are a few reasons why this distrust of science exists:

- conflicts with religious belief
- conflicts with short-term economic prospects (climate change deniers being funded by co2 emitting corporations)
- people that are predisposed to alternative medicine

A lot of scientific findings counter common sense and challenge our assumptions about reality

We feel less central and self important of our own species

Science changes very quickly and people are more reluctant to change their opinions with it because they think science is immutable (people feel jerked around and confused)

Science is based on **incremental findings** building on past achievements or [[paradigm]]s

This doesnt mean that science finds something more, but it also finds new things (electrons, general relativity, new species of extinct humans) **as well as** new ways that **people understand the world**

The laws and processes of the natural world exist independently of humans discovering them (what if we discovered them wrong?)

Our insights are variable and changing, the way the universe works is a constant

It's hard for scientists and normal people to give up the science seal of approval

## SCIENCE IS A PROCESS not A FINAL DESTINATION

It's up to us to distinguish when to drop a paradigm in lieu of a new one, this can be very difficult

Animals used to be considered to have no human qualities (anthropomorphism) but now the paradigm has changed and animal minds are now legit candidates for research (cognitive ethology)

The paradigm Descartes' created of the mind and body being separate things is slowly finding less meaning:

>‘You, your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will,’ wrote Francis Crick in _The Astonishing Hypothesis_ (1994), ‘are in fact no more than the behaviour of a ==vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules.’==

Individual lives are indeed fragile, but _life_ is remarkably robust.

People have difficulty accepting the shifting and permeable reality

There can also be doubt within the new paradigms themselves (the rate of evolution rather than if it occurs at all or climate change deniers focusing on the changing data and predictions)


==Our reality hasn’t become unstable; it’s just that our understanding of reality is of necessity a work in progress==

Science is taught in a laundry list of things to memorize, which makes it seem like science is immutable

Every paradigm lost is compensated by wisdom found.
