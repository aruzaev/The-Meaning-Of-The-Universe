# [[Globalization and Climate Change Part 1]]

## Humanity and the Environment
---

Much of what we depend on in the natural environment is produced over long periods of time and requires a delicate balance in order to exist

Using up resources that are non-renewable (take centuries to grow back like trees or fossil fuels) is incredibly damaging to the environment and the local ecosystems

Simple solutions such as replanting trees and recycling don't outweigh the negative effects of using these resources (the volume of production is too high)

## A Closer Look
---

97% of scientists agree that global warming is caused by human activity

The natural greenhouse effect is a very good thing and makes the earth warm enough to inhabit

The issue is when there is too much GHG released, which thickens the layer that traps heat and further heats the earth than necessary which **throws off the balance**

Rising water levels from melting ice can displace millions living in low sea-level areas, which makes them migrate to locations **that might not have the resources to support them**

## The Ecological Dimension of Globalization
*Steger, M - Chapter 6" pp. 92-108*

---

Western society tends to view nature as a "resource" rather than a cooperative partner

Capitalist industry seeks to convince people that the meaning of life and happiness is in consumerism and buying things

Half of the 1000x population increase has occurred in the last 30 years following the Industrial Revolution, this has put strain on the planet's ecosystem as the demand for stuff rises

**The rising pollution levels isn't because of the total world population, but the per capita consumption of each country**

e.x. US only makes up 6% of the world's population but consumes 30-40% of the world's resources
### Effects of overconsumption and overpopulation

**Food crisis** with more limitations of food in parts of the world because of drought or the use of corn for biofuel to reduce reliance on oil, also unequal distribution of resources between developed and developing countries

**Loss of biodiversity** with fastest mass extinction in history, degradation of farmlands and wetlands and freshwater ecosystems

50% of all animal species might disappear by the end of the century

Gene banks in over a hundred countries (Svalbard Seed Vault) but its doubtful that these banks will be sufficient to reverse loss of biodiversity

**Transboundary pollution** is another grave danger consisting of vast amounts of synthetic chemicals being released into the air causing issues for human, animal, and plant life

Late 20th century use of CFCs depleted Earth's ozone layer causing **ozone holes**

Also industrial emissions of Sulphur and nitrogen impacts forests, soils, and freshwater ecosystems creating higher amounts of acid and acid rain

Pope Francis even came out to the UN to speak about the effects of climate change

All of these chemicals in the greenhouse layer has enhanced earth's ability to trap heat

### Effects of global warming

Predictions that the average temperatures in 2100 will be up 8 degrees which will greatly disrupt the **delicate balance of the earth's ecosystems**

This may cause extreme weather events such as:
- storms
- wild fires
- floods
- droughts

**Melting of ice caps** because of the warming which could result in sea levels rising by 22 feet (6 meters)

Small coastal regions like Tuvalu will no longer exist and big coastal cities will lose a chunk of their landmass

**Overfishing, loss of coral reefs, coastal pollution, acidification, and oil spills** are another problem that contributes to out planet's poor health

Great Pacific Garbage Patch caused by illegal dumping of hazardous wastes is 2x the size of Texas 

Floating debris field caused by Japan's earthquakes and tsunamis and Fukushima which released tons of nuclear particles into the air and water

It contains tons of toxic materials such as:
- wall insulation
- oil
- gas canisters
- car tires
- fishing nets
- Styrofoam buoys 

And half of it has already sank to the surface

**All of these disasters are GLOBAL, meaning that they are problems for all living things on our planet**

Poor countries don't have the adequate resources to adapt to climate change and since they are so reliant on agriculture (which is failing), their economies will be severely impacted

Further effects will be:
- increased illnesses
- bigger death rate
- crumbling infrastructure
- higher cost of living (bad for poor households and poor communities like tribal)

### How are countries responding to climate change?

Even though there are a lot of plans, there have been very few implementations in the real world

**Lack of political will from China and the US, the biggest polluters have significantly stagnated progress of reversing climate change**

Both nations only want to slow global warming for their own economic growth

##### Countries blaming each other while doing nothing

A lot of agreements for limitations on carbon emissions such as rich countries in the EU and Australia with national carbon tax

Poor countries seem to think they shouldn't have these limitations for two reasons:
1. They need to build up industries and infrastructure so they aren't poor
2. They think they aren't the ones responsible for most of the GFG emissions (the developed world is at fault, not them)

The US disagreed and demanded developing nations take more responsibility for their pollution BUT at the same time they are reluctant to do anything about climate change in fear that it will impact THEIR FINANCIAL GROWTH

Bush with the US walked out of key treaties like the Kyoto Protocol while failing to commit to reversing climate change

Obama didn't do anything either

Many national states actually made a bunch of toothless declarations and did nothing

##### Finally good stuff?

2015 UN Paris conference made four agreements with all countries about climate change for the first time in history:
1. Parties pledged to commit themselves to stop rising global temps
2. Pledged to reduce GHG emissions by human activities to the level which the trees, soil, and oceans can absorb them naturally between 2050 and 2100
3. Pledged to review each other's commitment to cutting GHG emissions every 5 years or so to scale up the challenge
4. Pledged for rich countries to help the poor ones to switch to renewable energy and adapt to climate change by providing *climate finance*

However this agreement isn't legally binding, thus relying on peer pressure

## The Global Deal
---
*# Stern, N. (2009) The global deal: climate change and the creation of a new era of progress and prosperity. New York: Public Affairs. (excerpts)*

The problems of overcoming poverty in developing countries and stopping climate change are linked

Focusing only on one issue will be at the expense of the other

### The danger and the response

Most of the damage is from the lack of water (droughts, floods, rising sea level)

A temp of only 5 degrees will greatly impact the world

**The cost of action will be much lower than the cost of inaction**

It is not wise to stop economic growth in lieu of combatting climate change as there will be less people on board with it (especially poor countries)

In order for the world to continue growing, two things must happen first:
1. finding a way of increasing living standards (health, education, liberty) so that poverty is eradicated
2. Find a way of living that is sustainable environmentally 

### The nature of the market failure

There must be an agreement that GHG emissions are a market failure

Emitting GHGs damages prospects for other people and causes massive costs of damages

Producing less products is not only good for the environments, but also creates economic gains because producing waste damages the environment + supply and demand (maybe)

There are a few forms of market failures, including:
- lack of information
- abuse of market power
- externalities (when an action of one person impacts another negatively such as dumping toxic waste into a river)

These failures need to be fixed through taxes or regulations instead of abandoning markets

If these failures persist, the environment will continue to be damaged and growth will be stifled

**Emissions** are an example of an externality and a market failure and its impact can be broken down in four ways:
1. it is long-term
2. it is global
3. it involves major uncertainties
4. it is of a huge scale

Less waste and more new technologies will be the **most important things to reducing market failures**

**Ratchet effect** and the decisions that we make now will have profound impacts on the future

Rich countries must show leadership or no one will do anything

Many policies and discussions seem to equate combatting climate change to building a road or bridge, but in reality it is much larger scale than that because it impacts the global economy

### Shaping policy

The criteria in creating policies needs to be:
- efficiency (keeping costs down)
- equity (understanding differences in incomes, tech, and historical responsibilities)

Ignoring climate change would be a bad investment, even for poor countries 

Development of tech and economies is important for adapting to climate change

Reaching a climate change deal with cooperation from all states can lay the foundation to tackle wider issues such as
- less wars
- trade
- financial instability
- disease
- drugs
- increase in nuclear weapons
- poverty

### A planet in peril

If we develop new technologies that make the earth have a lower carbon footprint, we are planting seeds for sustainable growth 

With environmental goals and regulations, we can boost the world economy and eradicate poverty

**We either succeed on both or we fail on both**, there is no stability in between

The primary obstacle to both of these issues is **political will**

There has been more understanding about climate change

There has been a lot of enthusiasm about fixing climate change from UK, France, Germany, and Japan but a severe lack from the US, Canada, Italy, and Russia

China is carefully analyzing how they could cut emissions and are committed to it
