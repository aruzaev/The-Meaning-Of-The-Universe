# [[Measuring memory]]

Psychologists use three main ways to measure memory:
1. recall
2. recognition
3. relearning

## Recall
---
This is the most difficult

Recall means to produce information from memory without the need for *retrieval cues*
- these are hints and might be the first letters of required words in a fill in the blank question

Sometimes *serial recall* is needed, which is the recall of information in a specific order such as the alphabet or poems

## Recognition
---
The ability to recognize something familiar such as:

- a face
- a name
- a melody

This is used in multiple choice, matching, and true/false questions

Recognition for multiple choice questions doesn't require supplying the information from memory but just recognizing it when you see it, which makes it *easier* than recall

The **hippocampus** is responsible for this process

## Relearning
---
this means that things are still in your brain even if they cant be recalled or recognized
