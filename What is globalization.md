# [[What is globalization]]?

[[Globalization]] is a concept that has existed since the 30s but didn't officially blow up until the 90s, which when the ICT revolution ([[Information revolution]])

There are *three* key concepts to globalization:

1. Globality
2. Global Imaginary
3. Globalization

## Globality

A social condition^ that describes the tightly knit global economic, political, cultural, and environmental webs and flows which challenge any physical borders or boundaries

Globality is ***not*** a goal or an endpoint, it just is a condition of the world

There are many kinds of flavors of globality depending on the social structure of a connection (could be based on individualism, competition, laissez-faire (free-market) capitalism)

*^not like conditioning of the mind but just a way of life, an existing circumstance

---
## Global Imaginary

The growing awareness that we as people are members of a global community, and not just the community of our nation or city

This upsets the national and local frameworks and causes them to not be as powerful as the ever-growing globality of the world

---
## Globalization

A process signifying the change from traditional nationality to globality

It's a social change like *modernization*

---

Globalization doesn't only work on the global scale, it also creates change in the national and local scale by entangling those spaces with global spaces.

In other words, a city in the middle of nowhere can now communicate with the entire world through the use of ==globalization==
