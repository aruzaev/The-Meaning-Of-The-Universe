# [[Neurons and Neurotransmitters]]

Every action, emotion, and thought that you have is a result of activity from cells in your brain called neurons

Neurons help perceive the world around you by bringing information into your body through your senses, helping you:
- think 
- feel
- move
- speak

Neurons exist in the brain and the spinal cord and they connect your spinal cord to the rest of your body

They send signals from your body, up the spinal cord to your brain and the brain gives instructions using these signals to the rest of the body to allow for movement, communication, and other things

1. **Cell Body (Soma):** The central part of the neuron that contains the nucleus and regulates essential cellular functions.
2. **Nucleus:** Contains the neuron's genetic material and controls its activities.
3. **Dendrites:** Branching extensions that receive signals from other neurons and transmit them toward the cell body.
4. **Schwann Cells (Glial Cells):** Supportive cells that wrap around axons, providing insulation and support in the peripheral nervous system.
5. **Myelin:** Fatty substance that insulates and speeds up signal transmission along certain axons.
6. **Axon:** A long projection that carries electrical signals away from the cell body to transmit information.
7. **Axon Terminal:** Branches at the end of the axon that release neurotransmitters to transmit signals to other neurons.
8. **Synapse:** Specialized junction where neurons communicate through the release and reception of neurotransmitters.


Neurons get information from the dendrites from another neuron, then the signal gets passed along the axon, across the axon terminals, and goes through the synapses to another neuron

These electrical signals are called **action potentials**
