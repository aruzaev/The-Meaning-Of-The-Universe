3f# [[Anxiety disorders and OCD]]
*World of Psychology - 13.2*

---

**Anxiety** is when there is a general uneasiness or feeling that something bad is going to happen

It can be felt in response to a specific situation or without any specific reason and is a very **normal thing to experience**

**Normal anxiety** is a response to a real danger and threat which can lead us to take helpful actions to preserve our safety (i.e. when you're in the middle of nowhere at night and your gas tank is on empty)

**Abnormal anxiety** is when anxiety is not in response to any real danger or if it doesn't fade after a danger has passed or if it *interferes* with a person's social and work abilities

Anxiety disorders are the most common forms of mental disorders in Canada, affecting **12% of the population**

There are at least **5** forms of anxiety disorders:
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- Panic Disorder
- Social Anxiety Disorder
- Specific Phobia
- Obsessive Compulsive Disorder

## Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

People that have *excessive* anxiety which they find difficult to control and has an impact on their day to day lives

They may worry about:
- their finances
- their own health
- health of family members
- performance at work
- their ability to function in social settings

This can cause them to feel irritable, tense, edgy, tired with difficulty concentrating and sleeping

Some other symptoms include:
- trembling
- palpitations
- sweating
- dizziness
- nausea
- diarrhea
- frequent urination

2.5% of more Canadians 15 years and older have experienced GAD in the last 12 months

The heritability of GAD is about 28%

Causes a significant decrease in the quality of life

## Panic Disorder

People who have recurring panic attacks and have fear of having a panic attack and the consequences of them may have a panic disorder

This apprehension may cause people affected with this disorder to avoid situations where they previously had a panic attack

Symptoms of a panic attack include:
- attacks of overwhelming anxiety, fear, or terror
- pounding heart
- uncontrollable shaking/trembling
- feeling of being choked or smothered
- feeling like they are going to die or going crazy

Panic attacks typically occur when a person perceives a situation as being catastrophic

The more disastrous a situation seems, the more intense the panic attack will be

The **limbic system** (part of brain tied to emotion) and the **prefrontal cortex** (part of brain tied to planning, attention, problem-solving, decisions, and social cognition) are associated with the panic disorder

People that have panic disorder visit the hospital and ER quite often and they respond well to medication and psychotherapy

## Phobias: Persistent and Irrational Fears

A phobia is a persistent and irrational fear of an object, person, situation, or activity with no real danger behind it or the danger being blown out of proportion

People with phobias usually **know that their phobias are irrational**

There are three classes of phobias:
1. Agoraphobia
2. Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)
3. Specific Phobia

### Agoraphobia

The intense fear of a situation that can cause immense anxiety and where escape isn't an easily accessible option

Sometimes, a person will plan out their life around avoiding terrifying situations such as:
- busy streets
- crowded stores
- restaurants
- public transportations

People with agoraphobia rarely leave their home

You have a higher risk of developing agoraphobia if your relatives have it, the closer the relative the higher the risk

Women are twice as likely to get diagnosed with agoraphobia as men

### Social Anxiety Disorder

An intense fear of social situations where they might embarrass themselves in front of others

They might shake, blush, sweat, or appear clumsy in front of other people

They may fear eating, talking, and writing in front of others or do anything else that could make other people think poorly of them

This disorder can be incredibly disabling with people losing out on opportunities at work or school and their social lives

Higher risk of drug use

### Specific Phobia

A term used for any other phobia besides agoraphobia and SAD

Specific phobias, in order of frequency are:
1. Situational phobias (elevators, planes, enclosed spaces, tunnels, bridges)
2. Fear of the natural environment (storms, water, heights)
3. Animals (dogs, snakes, insects, mice)
4. Blood and injury phobia (seeing blood or an injury, receiving an injection)

Fear of closed spaces and fear of heights (acrophobia) are the most commonly treated phobias by therapists

People with specific phobias greatly exaggerate the dangers of these things 

The **difference between a fear and a phobia** is that a phobia is when something causes a great deal of distress and they will do everything in their power to avoid it

#### Causes of Phobias

Heredity is an important factor (people are 3x as likely to develop the phobia if their relative has it)

Specific phobias and SAD are most likely because of conditioning and modelling - learning

Frightening experiences

Observational learning in childhood (kids hearing about how scary the dentist is from their parents)

Phobias are most
likely acquired through a combination of genetic predisposition,
conditioning, and observational learning.

## Obsessive-Compulsive and Related 

People with OCD suffer from recurring **obsessions** and **compulsions** such as doing time consuming rituals over and over such as washing their hands over and over until they are bleeding

### Obsessions

Are persistent, recurring, involuntary thoughts and images or impulses that invade the consciousness and cause a lot of distress

Some common obsessions are:
- if a surface is contaminated with germs
- if they performed a certain act (turning off the stove or locking the door)
- persistent doubt that they turned off the stove or put out a cigarette
- aggression
- religion
- sex

Many people are so horrified by their obsessions that they think they're going insane

### Compulsions

A compelling feeling to repeat certain acts or rituals over and over again

The person doing these actions knows that they are irrational, but if they resist doing them they will build up **anxiety**

This anxiety is only alleviated by doing the compulsive act

Even though most people sometimes do compulsive behaviors,

it becomes a psychological program when the person:
- cannot resist doing them
- when it becomes too time consuming 
- or when it interferes with normal activities and relationships

Compulsions usually include cleaning, counting, checking, touching objects, excessive ordering

Sometimes there is a ==magical== belief that doing these rituals will cause a certain outcome to occur (family member wont die if i dont step on this crack)

People with OCD don't enjoy these rituals but they cant help themselves

1.1% to 1.8% of Canadians suffer from OCD

#### Causes of OCD

There may be a biological reason for OCD in some patients such as:
- early autoimmune diseases
- early strep infections
- changes in the brain from an infection that could predispose a person to OCD
- genetic factors

Genes affecting serotonin are suspected in causing OCD for some people

SSRIs help
