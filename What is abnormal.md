# [[What is abnormal]]
*World of Psychology - 13.1*

---

Behavior lies on a continuum and there aren't two groups of people (mentally well adjusted vs. abnormal and mentally disturbed)

One end is well adjusted and the other is disturbed, all people fall under this spectrum

There are a few questions to help determine if a certain behavior is abnormal:
- **Is the behavior considered strange within the person's own culture?**
  One behavior that may be normal in one culture may be completely abnormal in another
- **Does the behavior cause personal distress?** 
  If people experience considerable emotional distress without an experience in life that warrants that reaction, they may have a psychological or mental disorder. However, not everybody that has a psychological disorder will feel emotional distress, some can just be content with who they are
- **Is the behavior maladaptive?**
  Does this behavior lead to healthy or impaired functioning? Does it interfere with your day to day activities? If so, then experts say that this is the best way to tell if a behavior is abnormal
- **Is the person a danger to themselves or others?**
  If so then they can be committed to a mental institution. A person has to be judged mentally ill and a danger to himself and others
- **Is the person legally responsible for his or her acts?**
  Not guilty due to a mental disorder or insanity
