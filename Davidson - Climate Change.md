# [[Davidson - Climate Change]]
---

Climate change has occurred throughout all of the world's history

Since the **Industrial Revolution** and the beginning of heat-trapping greenhouse gasses being released by human activity, the earth has been warming at a very quick rate

This rising temperature causes extreme natural disasters and displaces many people, habitats, and animals

Coal fired power plants and carbon taxes are put in place to mitigate climate change

## Key Terms: Climate Change
---

- **Greenhouse gases** - Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere (carbon dioxide (co2) and methane (ch4))
- **Pre-industrial** - The years before industrialization was complete in North America and Europe (before the 1800s), normally used as a benchmark for current temps and rates of global warming
- **Carbon sink** - Natural or technological process of absorbing carbon from the atmosphere (trees, soils, and oceans do this but they have a limited capacity for carbon they can absorb)
- **Feedback loop** - The negative or positive outcome of a certain process that can elevate or dampen the effect of the process itself
- **Anthropogenic** - Human centered, used to describe changes to nature caused by humans

## Background
---

Climate is the average weather over an extended time in a certain location

It is the set of conditions that cause weather (e.x. average temperatures and humidity)

These conditions are created by:
- topology
- large body masses (lakes and oceans, why Vancouver is so warm and Toronto isn't as cold)
- composition of the atmosphere (why holes in the atmosphere from greenhouse gasses are so dangerous, this is the most significant effect on air temperatures)

The world's climate changes in cycles:
> from cooling stage (ice age) to gradual warming stage (when the ice age ice sheets in NA melted over the next 14,000 years)

## How Do Scientists Measure Climate Change?
---

They measure average temperatures (globally or regionally) and evaluate those changes in temperatures over time

They use data collected since the 1880s all throughout weather stations in the world

If they want to get data from before the 1880s, they use biological and physical phenomena such as *tree rings*, *precipitation*, *humidity*, and *cloud cover*

## How Fast is the Earth Warming?
---

Historically before the industrial revolution, the rate of climate change has been very slow

The global average temperatures are now 1 C higher than what it was in the pre-industrial period

Although the change seems small, it still cases major shifts in weather patterns, water cycles, and ecosystems

**The climate balance on earth is very delicate and any slight shift in the temperature can have disastrous consequences**

## How Are Humans Responsible?
---

Any human activity that causes the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere contributes to an increase in global average temps

The most significant greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (co2) and methane (ch4)

On their own, these gases are harmless and natural **but** when they're released in excess, the cause immense climate change

The majority (70%) of greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, which have a high carbon content

These fossil fuels are burned via **power plants, buildings, and vehicles**

**Changes in the usage of land**, such as **deforestation** and **farming** also contributes to global warming because it reduces the effectiveness of two of the most important **natural carbon sinks**

Using air pockets that were found in ice cones in Antarctica and Greenland, scientists determined two things:
1. There is a clear relationship between the amount of co2 in the atmosphere and average temps
2. Co2 in the atmosphere remained stable until the Industrial revolution, where the concentration began to climb considerably (280 ppm to 400 ppm in 2015)

## Projections
---

General Circulation Models used to predict future climate conditions

If climate change remains uncontrolled, the average temp will be +2C by 2050 and +4C by 2100

The Arctic surface has a lot of permafrost that has a lot of methane and co2 trapped in it, if it is melted, a lot of these greenhouse gases will be released in the air

Methane is 84x more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2

Eventually the heat that is stored in the oceans will be released into the atmosphere

## What is the Impact of Climate Change
---

Sea levels rising (over 20cm over the 20th century) and will continue to rise until 1 m

At 1m, millions of people on the coastlines are at risk and a lot of animal life

There will also be an increase in extreme weather events such as: 
- droughts
- heat waves
- extreme storms
- forest fires
- crop failures

There will also be declines in agricultural productivity

Water supplies
More rain than snow

Plants and animals will  have to migrate because they are sensitive to shifts in temps and water cycles

Mountain species are at risk because they have nowhere to go

## Adaptation
---

Reality of the pace of rising sea levels and global warming has far exceeded past observations

This emphasizes the need for adaptation

If all of the emissions were stopped right now, there would still be greenhouse gases in the atmosphere causing climate change for the next few decades

Governments are starting to take adaptation seriously by doing vulnerability assessments and developing plans

Businesses are investing as well such as with building weatherization

## International Co-operation
---

UN created the Framework Convention on Climate Change which was a treaty for stabilizing the amount of greenhouse gasses concentrated in the air

One element of this framework is establishing an international scientific body to research climate change and be the leading authority on it

There are COP meetings but they don't really do anything

Their main goal is to keep the global temperature under 2C

Paris agreement - a document outlining the ways in which the international community will work together to keep it under 2C by reducing emissions and meeting every 5 years and financial support for developing countries

Nearly 200 countries signed it

If it exceeds 2C, there is a high probability of destroying many ecological and meterogical conditions that support society 

## Solutions
---

There are three main ways to mitigate climate change:

1. Reducing the amount of greenhouse gases caused by human activity either by using less or switching to alternative fuels that are more environmentally friendly (conventional mitigation)
2. Emitted carbon can be captured before it is released into the atmosphere and stored underground, its being implemented in power plants but is expensive (carbon capture and storage (CCS))
3. Removing carbon that is currently in the atmosphere (such ass reforestation)
4. (ONLY ON PAPER) Geo-engineering such as cloud seeing (increasing precipitation by dispersing substances in them ) this is highly speculative

## How Much Mitigation is Needed?
---

The need for climate change mitigation has become more urgent than ever

Limiting global warming to 1.5C can substantially reduce the effects of climate change, however this would require net zero gas emissions by 2040

## Who is Responsible?
---

China is the major polluter and it will take much longer for its emissions to go down

It's mostly a political answer and because it is so it makes it difficult for there to be any real progress

## Climate Change Deniers
---

A lot of people and corporations that stand to lose something if carbon emissions are reduced like oil companies

These organizations fund conservative think tanks such as AEI and the Fraser Institute which support conservative ideologies under the guise of objectivity

Skeptics cling onto that lack of 100% certainty that climate change is caused by humans; an unreasonable metric where 97% of scientists agree

Politically conservative white men are more likely to support the skeptics

The number of these deniers are declining with more and more of the organizations that skeptics supported coming to terms with the reality of climate change (congressmen, pope francis)

Multinational orgs like the IMF and World Bank have established climate change mitigation as a high priority

## How is Canada Responding to Climate Change?
---

Canada used to have a very carbon emission dense industry, energy

It has one of the world's largest reserves for fossil fuels such as oil

Decisions that Canada makes about these reserves impacts the rest of the world majorly

Kyoto Protocol, but was never put in place by the government

Ontario phased out coal power plants in 2014 and replaced them with renewable plants and lower emission sources

BC with carbon tax
