Before Java variables can be used, they must be declared
Types are verified before the code even runs

All code must be a part of a class, especially functions
A function that is in a class is called a method
All functions are methods

All parameters of a function must have a declared type and the return type two

Functions in java can only return one value

Write code that is self documenting and readable

Whenever you write a function, be sure to comment each thing
