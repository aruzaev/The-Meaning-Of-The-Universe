# [[The Futile Pursuit of Happiness]]

1. lots of money
2. a good and stable job
3. owning property
4. good friends
5. having a lot of knowledge

You are most likely wrong how you will predict in the future

All actions, such as:
- decision to buy jewelry
- having kids
- buying a big house
- working more for more money

are based on our predictions of the emotional consequences of those events

Humans understand what we want and we are good at improving our well being and maximizing our utility

We tend to **overestimate the duration and intensity of our emotional reactions to future events** (our affect)
> it will always be less exciting than we thought nor will it last as long as we think

Bad events proved less intense and more transient than expected, good events too

**Impact bias** - the gap between what we predict our response will be and what we actually experience

This bias can lead to **miswanting** - wanting the wrong things because what we think will make us happy is incorrect

The real problem is figuring out which future will really make us happy

You can't know what you want
