*World of Psychology - 13.4*

Schizophrenia is the most serious disorder, affecting 1/100 people in adolescence or early adulthood

It is thought that the developmental process in late adolescence causes this

It brings a lot of disruption to social life and family life

## The Symptoms

The symptoms are positive (meaning present, not good), which are:

### Hallucinations

People may see. hear, taste, or smell things without a stimulus in the environment

Hearing voices is the most common hallucination (some may hear God or Satan or a family member)

The voices are typically unpleasant, giving commentary to his or her behaviors'. Sometimes they are menacing and tell the person to kill someone or themselves

**Visual hallucinations** are less common and can take the form of:
- friends
- relatives (dead or alive)
- God
- Jesus
- the devil

There can also be **bodily hallucinations** which feel like they are being beaten, burned, or sexually violated

### Delusions

**Delusions are false beliefs that are not shared by other people in the culture**

People cannot be convinced that their delusions are false even when given evidence

There are different types of delusions:

- **Delusions of grandeur** - the belief that they are an important person with great knowledge, ability, or authority (the Queen, Jesus Christ)
- **Delusions of persecution** - the belief that some agency is out to get them by harassing, spying, conspiring against, and killing them 

Other examples of delusions are:
- The belief that your every thought is being broadcast to everyone around you
- The belief that some agency is stealing your thoughts and planting ones that aren't yours

### Disturbances in Forming Thought or Speech

The most common form of thought disturbance is when **the patient isn't able to follow one train of thought to completion**

They frequently bounce from thought to thought based on vague connections

The speech patterns of people with schizophrenia is difficult to understand (the content may be vague or they may invent words or use the wrong words to describe things)

> I am writing on paper. The pen I am using is from a factory called “Perry & Co.” This factory is in England… . The city of London is in England. I know this from my school-days. Then, I always liked geography. My last teacher in that subject was … a man with black eyes. I also like black eyes. There are also blue and gray eyes and other sorts, too. I have heard it said that snakes have green eyes. All people have eyes. There are some, too, who are blind.

### Grossly Disorganized Behavior

This can include things such as:
- childlike silliness
- inappropriate sexual behavior (masturbating in public)
- disheveled appearance
- weird fashion
- unpredictable agitation (random shouting or swearing)
- inappropriate motor behavior (strange gestures, facial expressions, postures)

### Inappropriate Affect

This is when their facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures don't reflect the emotions that are normal under those circumstances

Crying during a comedy show
Laughing when hearing news about bloody bodies being removed from an accident

The symptoms that are **negative** (deficient from normal functioning) include:

- social withdrawal
- apathy (not caring about anything)
- loss of motivation
- lack of goal-oriented activities
- very limited speech
- slow movements
- poor hygiene
- poor problem-solving skills
- distorted sense of time

Some patients have a **flat effect** or no emotional response at all such as:

- speaking in a monotone voice
- facial expressions are blank and emotionless
- act and moving like robots

People that have negative symptoms often have **the worst life outcomes**

They are too dysfunctional to hold a job or care for themselves

## Brain Abnormalities in Some Schizophrenic Patients

Some patients have **low levels of neural activity in the frontal lobes**

Many have **defects** in the neural circuits of the **cerebral cortex and limbic system**

There is **reduced volume** in the **hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and front lobe grey matter**

They have **abnormal lateralization** and slow communication between **left and right hemispheres**

## The Causes of Schizophrenia

There is a complex interaction of inherent and environmental factors involved in the development of it

### Genetic Inheritance

Schizophrenia tends to run in families with a **major role in genetics**

Genes aren't the only indicators of it, genes and **environmental factors** play a major role in this

If there are highly stressful situations AND the person is highly sensitive and vulnerable to stresses (diathesis-stress model), then there is a high chance of developing schizophrenia

Other environmental factors can interfere with normal brain development and can increase the risk of schizophrenia:
- birth trauma
- a virus like the flu
- malnutrition
- head injury
- etc

### Excessive Dopamine Activity

Many schizophrenics have abnormal levels of dopamine in their brains

Medications that act on dopamine tend to be helpful for schizophrenics

It's **unlikely** that only one neurotransmitter can create the crazy features of schizophrenia

Glutamate and GABA and other neurotransmitters also influence this

## Gender and Schizophrenia

More likely to happen to men than women

Men develop it at an earlier age, do not respond well to treatment, and spend more time in the hospitals

The earlier age is independent of culture or socio-economic variable
