# [[Phases of SDLC]]

An SDLC is a structured step-by-step approach for developing software

It is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality software in the shortest amount of time

 Typical activities include:
 - determining budgets
 - gathering business requirements
 - designing models
 - writing user documentation

## Phase 1: Planning

This involves determining a solid plan for developing your system/software

Split up into three categories:
1. Define the system to be developed
2. Set the project scope
3. Develop the plan

### Define the system to be developed

Define what kind of system that the company/client needs to have in their daily operation

This is usually done by:
1. Identifying business needs
	1. Need to understand the specific business needs that the system will address. Can included things like improving existing business processes or automating manual tasks or increasing efficiency
### Set the project scope

1. Scope and Objectives
	1. Outlines the scope of the project, what the system will and will not do
	2. Should be clear and measurable to avoid adding more requirements last minute, which can cause delay and drive up costs, this is called **scope creep and feature creep**

**Project scope document** -- a written definition of the project scope and is usually no longer than a paragraph

### Develop the project plan including tasks, resources, and time frames

- **Project plan** - defines the what, when, and who questions of systems development
- **Project manager** - a person who is an expert in project planning and management, creates and enforces the project plan in order to ensure that all the key project milestones are completed on time
- **Project milestones** - the key dates for which a certain group of activities need to preformed

## Phase 2: Analysis

This involves the end users and IT specialists working together to understand, gather, and document the business requirements for the planned system

Its split up into two activities

1. Gather the business requirements
2. Prioritize the requirements

### Gathering the business requirements

- **Business requirements** - a detailed set of requirements that the business/client requests that the system must meet in order to be successful
- **Joint application development (JAD)** - knowledge workers and IT specialists meet for several days to define and review the business requirements of the system

### Prioritize the requirements

**Requirements definition document** - prioritizes the business requirements and places them in a formal comprehensive document

## Phase 3: Design

Build a technical blueprint of how the proposed system will work

Two primary design activities:
1. Design the technical architecture
2. Design system models

### Design the technical architecture

**Technical architecture** - defines the hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment needed to run the system

### Design system models

**Modeling** - the activity of drawing a graphical representation of a design
**Graphical user interface (GUI)** - the interface to a system
**GUI screen design** - the ability to model the system screens for an entire system

## Phase 4: Development

Taking all of your design documents and transform them into an actual system

There are two primary development activities:
1. Build the technical architecture
2. Build the database and programs

## Phase 5: Testing

This phase verifies that the system works and meets all of the business requirements defined in the analysis phase

Two primary testing activities:
1. Writing the test conditions
2. Preforming the testing of the system

### Writing the test conditions

**Test conditions** - the detailed steps the system must be able to perform along with the expected results of each steps

### Perform the testing of the system

- **Unit testing** - testing the individual units of code
- **System testing** - verifies that the units of code are able to function correctly when integrated within the system
- **Integration system** - verifies that separate systems are able to work together
- **User acceptance testing (UAT)** - verifies that the customers like the system and that it satisfies the business requirements

## Phase 6: Implementation

Distributing the system to all of the knowledge workers and they begin using the system to perform their everyday jobs

Consists of two primary implementation activities

1. Writing detailed user documentation
	1. highlights how to use the system
2. Provide training for the system users
	1. Online training - runs over the internet or off a CD
	2. Workshop training - held in a classroom environment and lead by an instructor

You need to also choose the appropriate implementation method:
- **Parallel implementation** - using both the old and new systems at the same time
- **Plunge implementation** - discard the old system completely and use the new one
- **Pilot implementation** - start with small groups of people on the new one and slowly add new users
- **Phased implementation** - implement the new system in phases

## Phase 7: Maintenance

To monitor and support the new system to ensure that it continues to meet the business goals

Two maintenance activities:
1. Build a help desk to support the system users
2. Provide an environment to support system changes (updates)
