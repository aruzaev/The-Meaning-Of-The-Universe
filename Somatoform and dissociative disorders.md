## Somatic Disorders

**Soma** means body and **somatic symptom disorders** are disorders that cause bodily symptoms that have no explainable medical reason to them

They have a psychological reason behind them but many think they legitimately have something wrong with them physically

There are two disorders in this category:

- Illness Anxiety Disorder
- Conversion Disorder

### Illness Anxiety Disorder

People affected with this are also called "hypochondriacs" and are overly concerned about their health

They seem to consistently think that any bodily symptom is a sign of a serious disease or illness

Even if they are told their issue is purely psychological, they aren't easily convinced and will frequently "doctor shop" to seek confirmation for their fears

It's very hard to treat this and there is a poor chance of recovery

### Conversion Disorder: When thoughts and fears can paralyze

A diagnosis occurs when there is a loss of motor or sensory function of a certain part of the body that 
a) is not as a result of a physical injury
b) solved a psychological problem

It is thought that this disorder occurs when a person that is anxious cannot escape, defense mechanism (a soldier escaping the war because of paralysis)

A person with this disorder typically exhibits calm and indifferent feelings to their symptoms, which is abnormal, this is called ***la belle indifference***

They may even enjoy the attention or sympathy that their disability brings

## Dissociative Disorders

A dissociative disorder is a loss of consciousness, memory, identity, and perception of our environment

It's a **mental escape** to intolerable situations

There are two types of dissociative disorders:

- dissociative amnesia
- dissociative identity disorder

### Dissociative Amnesia

A person affected with amnesia is a partial or complete inability to recall personal information (name, identity, etc) or past experiences, it can't be attributed to normal forgetfulness

People with DA don't suffer from a physical injury that normally causes amnesia

Instead the "injury" comes from a psychological blow from a traumatic event which the person escapes by forgetting

People with DA can forget their identity and even their loved ones but they don't forget how to function and their base personality remains intact

Edgar Latulip in St. Catherines with no idea who he is

At times people with DA take on a completely new identity that is more outgoing than their old identity

This state may last for hours, days, or even months and is because of major psychological stress

### Dissociative Identity Disorder: Multiple Personality

When there are two or more distinct and unique personalities within the same individual

In 50 percent of people with DID, there are over 10 different personalities

The personalities change between one another suddenly but usually as a response to **stress**

**Host personality** - the one who has the most amount of control over the body the majority of the time

**Alter personalities** - the alternate personalities which can differ radically in intelligence, speech, accent, vocab, posture, body language, hairstyle, clothing taste, manners, and handwriting

Sometimes the alters can even differ in gender, age, and sexual orientation

People with DID often hear voices and crying and laughter in their head which can make it likely for them to be **misdiagnosed with schizophrenia**

The host isn't aware of their alters, but the alters are aware of the host

*lost time* - periods of amnesia because one personality took control over the body over that time

#### Causes of DID

Early trauma such as severe physical and sexual abuse

Begins early in childhood

More common in women than men

Alters taking control is a way of coping from intolerable abuse

Most likely a symptom of **PTSD** rather than its own diagnosis

Can be treated well with psychotherapy
