Job Descriptions

How to figure out what the job wants without talking to the recruiter
How to read between the lines

Ask about bachelors degree

Keep track of all the jobs that you apply to (excel sheet)
Sometimes you forget or don't know what kind of company you've applied to
Research more about the company before you apply to
It will help you present better and will help you understand how well you're doing in the job search
This is how you can be more self aware with your job search and sometimes the recruiters can ask you about it
(data analyst not knowing how many jobs they've applied to = not knowing their own data)

"I have applied to 25 jobs, I've heard back from 5 etc etc"

Look at the job title and figure out if you want that title
Full stack = back end and front end
Research the job company and figure out what it does, get into the habit of doing that
Take note of the location of the job and figure out where you want to work (always do that and don't waste yours and the recruiters time if you don't want to relocate)

Create a list of companies that you want to apply to and then apply
No job response = "Im not good enough", "they hired someone better" (things out of our control)

The biggest reason why you don't get the job response is because you came into the queue late

While the recruiter is already doing interviews and figuring out who they want, you send an application and they just won't look at it because they're already done with it

Figure out if it's full time, part time, or contract

Companies like candidates that have experience with other fields (if its a developer for a finance field, its good to have finance experience or education, it can even be from highschool, ANYTHING like academic work or volunteering)

Make sure that you understand the niche that you're applying to

Find out if they are progressive or laying people off (small team)

Find out more information about the company and what they do (if based in Australia and Canada ask if there would be a cross culture and you need to keep up with Australian time)

Ownership:
Collaboration
team success

talk about any kind of story about any of these things

Exemplify the qualities in the cover letter, interview that is needed in the job description (in my class i've collaborated with over 50 people etc or i won a prize)

Take a note of things that you have done or not done, take a note of things that you have done but they haven't mentioned it in the job description either mentally or on paper

If description said "best development practices" google it (different companies have different linting formats)

Be honest "i don't know" "i know but ive only done it academically"
They will know if you're not transparent

Don't think that you can't do anything without a bachelors degree, its a practical field so experience is the best

still apply even if you dont have any experience/fresh grad or not enough experience (maybe they like you, they liked your personality, they might say no now but in the future they may say yes) the interview will be your friend and will allow you to network

If you don't have experience with any framework, you pick one framework that you like and do a coursera course (if they ask you on the interview if you know the framework, say that you did a course and provide proof with some project)

Apply to a job -> while that job interview is being processed, do courses on a technology that they're asking for 

Even if you don't get an interview you will still get a lot of certs and academic experience and you'll learn a lot and make your resume really good

"Strong verbal and written communication skills" this is something that you exemplify, don't just say that you're good at it
(ex. i was good at writing in highschool, i have a blogpost, i won a prize for an essay)
verbal is hard but there can still be examples (ex. I have my own youtube channel, i did toastmasters, i did debate club)

Don't just say you're good at something, exemplify is

Once you're in one field, its very hard to break out of it so stick in your own field

Be very clear about what you want to do and what kind of niche that you want to get into (don't just do any job, if you hate finance don't get into a finance related jobs)

You shouldn't jump around niches ("We've chosen an applicant that has always been in finance"), stick with one niche and boom. Stick with one arcade game and get really good at it

Ask about the job salary and benefits

"Why do you want to work at our company?" Companies will have a mission in their job descriptions and you need to have a story about the mission

Use your ability to why you believe and want to work with the company

Be excited about the job in the interview and talk about a lot of genuine and exciting things when asked why you want to work at the job

Don't just randomly apply for jobs, be selective to have a strategy for each job

Talk about a lot of those non technical jobs in the cover letter and not in the resume

50-60% of the skill set if you already know on the description, still apply
ideally 80%

So many people are responsible for writing the job description, it's not just the recruited

Sometimes if you say you have a certain skill on a resume theyll ask you about it (If you know AWS they could ask you about that)

Use chatgpt to paste the job description and ask it to ask you questions

Jobscan.co to see if your resume is good enough and it will make you a cover letter

Use grammarly = bad grammar is rly bad in your resume or cover letter
bitly.com will shorten url for linkedin or portfolio

Probability of finding a job will only improve if you have a quality job

In the reflection write which tools you could use to improve your job search and your resume and what kind of considerations that you need to make when looking at job descriptions
