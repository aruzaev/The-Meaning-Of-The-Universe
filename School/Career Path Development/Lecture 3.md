Skills identification

So many times we don'tt know who we are or what we bring to the table

How to find what we bring to the table/skills that we have 
# How to find your skill set - activities
## Day to Day activities 

(do I keep the house clean, do I talk to the neighbours, can I cook well) 

- Make a list/tracker of all of your activities Find out where you are spending the majority of the time during your day (playing video games, talking to somebody, cooking)

## Paid Job
(part time, full time)

"I didn't like to study/read/etc" - works a full time job and he hated it

Doing things that you don't like may give you an indicator with what you want to do in the future

Do things deliberately to figure out what you like and what you don't like

Don't experiment with a full time job because you can mess things up that way

## Internship

Programming and other areas have a lot of different jobs and specializations within them

An internship is a good idea to test out which one you like

The day that you graduated you should have an internship, having a gap is bad 
Do multiple internships back-to-back to figure out what you want to do, to further your experience

You can start applying and looking for internships from the very start of your education
> you will get rejected a lot but if you're persistent with it you can eventually land one

You don't search an internship the day after you graduate, you should already be looking for them and have one lined up

You learn from your failures and rejections (you get a better estimate with what you need to be doing and what technologies you need to learn)

You should already know the difficulties before you jump into the fire (how much money you have, how much money you have)

Keep applying throughout your course

The moment that you get an internship, keep applying to other internships while working as that intern

Don't be stingy with internships, these are ways to experiment what you want to do so there is minimal risk

Go to smaller companies (hard to get to by public transit/etc) because the likelihood 

**To find an internship**:

Not for profit organizations (not active on linkedin but active on instagram and facebook, connect with them)

COOP class (problem is that it is limited, time consuming, and very picky and they do suspicious things like recruiting for commission only jobs)

Go for low hanging fruit (even if they are rude etc etc)

Whatever is available might not be the most enticing (smelly worker, rude boss, bad job title)

Career center at humber college or government job agencies

**try everything and anything**

Your stakes are low because you're in school and very few people will ask question

## Volunteering

Volunteering just like internships are great for understanding what your skills are 

## Freelancing

## Academic Projects

# How to find your skill set - feedback

- Family
- Friends
- Community
- Teachers
- Supervisors

Talk to everybody that you know and ask them what you're good at and if a lot of people say the same thing then maybe that could be your skills

Figure out a list of feedback and convert those list items to something that can be done professionally

# How to find your skill set - psychologically

Strong suit = go to skill

Some people know how to lie/cheat/deceit
Some people know how to work very hard at anything

How much effort you put in isn't important
what IS more important is how much you output

sometimes you put in very minimal effort but a lot of output comes from it and that's great because you're using **your skills**

Look into aptitude/psychological tests

During the interview process, you can use those results and characteristics in the interview process

Use those results to talk about some stories where you've exemplified those skills in your professional/personal life during an interview

Many companies take aptitude/psychological tests very seriously especially during the interview process

Use personality tests to determine what you should do professionally

If you don't have this understanding about yourself, it won't look good during an interview

Do a lot of self reflection

# How to incorporate your skills into your professional documents

- Resume
- Cover letter
- Linkedin Profile
- Interview - Over the phone, video call, in person


"im detail oriented, im a team player,"

If you see these things in a job posting, add your skillset inventory to the resume

You don't need to incorporate every single skills on your resume

Only by email do they get the impression that you're good at writing
Phone interview = talking
Linkedin = can have pictures of you with people to show how big of a people person you are

Three skill sets on your resume

Different platforms will need to different skillset

# Transferable Skills

What do you do when you want to change careers?

- Produce a real life story when you found out that the job isn't for you
- Make a list of skills gained from previous experience
- Draw a venn diagram to see which skills collide
- meet with people who have gone through the same career transition

Don't be brutally honest lmao

Make it inspiring

Police officer of 15 years switching over to cybersec because he realized he could do more could if he got into cybersec

He also knew the technical things, he had a good list of skillset (he's analytical and he's investigative) and so he can apply those skills he got from the force to the cyber sec job
