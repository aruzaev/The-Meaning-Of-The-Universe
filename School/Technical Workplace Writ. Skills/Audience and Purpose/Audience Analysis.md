# [[Audience Analysis]]

An [[Audience Profile]] is needed before composing a technical document

All of your decisions about:
- medium
- content
- design
- tone
- wording
should be focused on making the information clear and accessible for the reader

---
## [[Audience]]

The writer will make the document for the [[primary audience]] and will send it directly to them

However sometimes the document gets forwarded or shared to people who are not the main readers, these people are called the [[secondary audience]]

Even though documents are specifically tailored for the primary audience, they should also account for secondary readers

## Audience Analysis

### [[Audience]]:

Identify the [[primary audience]] and the [[secondary audience]]
- who is this document written for?
- are the readers clients, managers, colleagues, other professionals, or members of the general public
- who else may read the document?

### Relationship:

Articulate your connection to the readers
- how strong is your current connection to these readers?
- what is your personal history and your company's history with the reader?

### Content:

Determine what information your readers already have and what they need
- what will the readers do with this information?
- how much technical knowledge do the readers have?
- what do the readers already know?
- what information do the readers need to receive?

### Reader Response:

Anticipate how the readers will react
- what medium and format does the reader expect?
- how do you think the readers will respond to the message?
- do you need to justify a decision/explain benefits/overcome objections?

### Context:

Examine the environment the document will be read within
- what is the history of the situation or project?
- any factors in your company or readers' company that will influence how the message is received?
- any current events in the world that will affect the way this information is received?
- is there any workplace governance for this type of communication?
