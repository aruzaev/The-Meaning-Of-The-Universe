# [[Politics and Globalization Part 1]]

After WW2

The Breton Woods system was dismantled because people no longer wanted to sell gold at a **fixed** price

This introduced the "float" system in which currencies are exchanged on supply and demand conditions rather than a fixed rate like with gold

IMF and lending money to countries to meet international currency demands

Countries were keen on cooperative governance of trade, finance and banking after WW2 because fighting was horrible

States deemed that **multilateralism** (many states working together) was necessary to prevent financial imbalance between countries

This worked through establishing institutions and international organization, marked the **emerging process of globalization**

Globalization has been driven mainly by economic interests - from the reconstruction of Europe after WW2

There are three types of globalization:

1. Economic 
2. Sociological/cultural
3. Political

## Economic

driven by market forces but has been encouraged by the actions of the government
(countries removing barriers to goods and services, which helped promote global capital gain and more money circulating)

Companies also started expanding their production globally and creating alliances with one another to integrate national markets

## Sociological/cultural

globalization created a "global society" and global norms

people stopped associating themselves with their cities or countries but with the billions of other people in the world

"Citizen of the world"

Global norms started appearing as worldwide communication became easier, which allowed for an exchange of worldwide opinions and wisdom

## Political

refers to political processes that occur throughout many borders, oftentimes even removing borders

Policies that were made now not only impacted the country, but also individuals across the world

Creating of NGOs that are in many different countries

Global movement towards democracy (is this because America is the most powerful nation?)

Ties national governments together with common issues

## The Cold War

Occurred between the US and the USSR between 1945-1991

Even though both countries fought against Hitler, they did not see the world in the same way

They had different goals for the international system (USSR a world under socialism and the US under political freedom, capitalism, and liberalism)

Hostile between both sides but not a bullet was fired at each other

The growing number of nuclear warheads between the two planted a lot of fear in people

A lot of **boycotting** (refusal to deal with another political community) happened, especially during the Olympic games

The cold war was the primary influence on world politics at the time

1963 Test Ban Treaty, recognition by both sides that **the nuclear arms race was out of control**

1970s both sought reconciliation with each other

**Detente** - warming of relations
**Rapprochement** - reconciliation

1980s Ronald Reagan created a second cold war because he continued to build up the army in response of USSR's "threat"

World wealth is mostly situated in the north hemisphere in a few countries while the south is poor

The gap between North and South is widening rapidly

The south asked for help and to redistribute wealth from the north but that didn't happen

The past few decades saw an increase in former "Third World" countries have newly industrialized sections (China, Mexico, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, HK, Thailand, Brazil, and Argentina)

The end of the Cold War **made us realize that there can be substantial change in international politics** brought on by **globalization**

Globalization affects everything

Rich countries developing an "Internet society" while poor, rural nations not really being affected by the raising telecommunications and internet (they miss out on the global market)

# Competing Approaches to International Politics

There are three main theoretical orientations in world politics:

- Realism
- Liberalism
- Marxism

## Realism
---
Assumes that countries only care about economic or military power

The international system is in a constant competition for power and this is the default thinking for most people who practice world affairs

Cooperation between nations isn't likely

Hans Morgenthau argues that human nature and societies are imperfect and **conflict is inherent**

People who make policies should do so for the sake of maximizing power

Realists believe that leaders can avoid war by not pursuing goals that they don't have the power to achieve, meaning that it is necessary to understand the goals and power of your opponents

The state, or country, is the only thing that's important in international affairs and the one that holds the most power (not corporations or institutions

**Realpolitik** - the approach to world politics that dictates that countries should practice politics based on power, and not morality

After WW2, this was based on **balance of power** - where states try to have equal power to prevent a country or an alliance from dominating the world
> can be done by: building own strength, allying yourself with others, and dividing your opponents
