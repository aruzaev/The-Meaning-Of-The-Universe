# [[Point - Globalization Provides a Better Life for All by Jennifer Graham]] 
---

**Thesis** - Globalization has occurred throughout history and is beneficial because it provides positive long term prosperity, security, and enrichment

## Introduction
---

**Definition** - Globalization is the increase flow of goods, services, people, and capital across international borders

The term was made in 1962 to describe the rising international integration that was pioneered by the Vikings

Christopher Columbus is the most infamous of globalizers who helped integrate Europe with the Americas

Transformation of Asian countries like China, India, Taiwan, HK, and Singapore in the 1900s proved how globalization can transform **poor countries into rich ones**

## Prosperity
---

In 2000, President Bill Clinton stated the importance of **open markets worldwide to improve standards of living and build shared prosperity**

Countries that have opened their economies to the world have been the **only ones to experience economic progress**

There has been a decrease in the amount of people living in **absolute poverty** (less than $1 per day) by hundreds of millions

There has been significant declines in **child labor**

Trade allows a country to **develop its resources and its citizen's skills** which increases **global input, makes production cheaper, and makes basic needs for people cheaper** (food, clothes, and shelter)
> Mexican farmhands who pick fruit in Cali, Bangladeshi clothing makers making things for Europeans, South Korea used to be as poor as Ghana but trade has made it much richer

Canada isolating itself from the world will impact the Canadian and world economy

Trade that doesn't include developing countries will reverse economic growth

## Security
---

President Bush and Obama mentioned that countries that have open markets are the most open to **democracy**

Democracy or a **liberal market economy** helps to keep the quest of profit at bay and to use it as a means to progress society

This makes habits for freedom that provide security

The shift to the democratic way of thinking has made more countries accountable to their citizens (e.x. China and India's citizens gaining personal liberties from improved economies)

From 2008, **the number of countries that went from autocracies to democracies grew by 30%**

Free trade expands security because it creates an **economically successful middle class** which has the money and power to have a right of choice in the **economy and politics**

This causes **women to be more educated**, which makes productive and dramatic improvements to industries and the economy

They are more keen on investing money in:
- education
- health
- nutrition
- family life

As profits of developing countries get higher, they can be invested in **training and education for unskilled workers** which improves wages and human rights
> also steers away from labor intensive, dangerous work

## Enrichment
---

Globalization enriches the human experience by **increasing cultural and economic integration**

This promotes diversity and opens up the global society to new ideas, technology, and communication

**Cost of communication has decreased as economies have gotten more efficient**
> Long distance 3 min call from NYC to London went from $300 in 1930 to <$0.10 in 2008

This increased the opportunities for economic growth and made the benefit of information available to everyone around the world

**Globalization and better communication has broken down racism** by transforming diversity into a valuable thing

Globalization adapts imported goods and services to the local traditions and needs 
"*glocalization*"
> McDonalds adapting its meals to not have beef in India because of the religious practices there

Globalization is a tool that allows individuals to develop their unique offerings and share them with the world

## Conclusion
---

Globalization ensures efficiency, which allows people to utilize their talents and countries to take full advantage of their resources

It also creates a rich, intelligent, and confident middle class to demand human and civil rights

It also enriches the human experience and creates interdependence, which secure the independence of the countries' own identities
