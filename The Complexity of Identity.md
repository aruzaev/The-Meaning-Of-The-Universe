# [[The Complexity of Identity]]

## Who am I?

The concept of identity is complex

Even though it can be shaped by things such as:
- individual characteristics
- the dynamics of my family
- historical factors (the history, culture, and traditions can influence this a lot)
- social/political contexts

### The Looking Glass Self

identity is **mostly** shaped by how the world around you sees you

> *other people are the mirror in which we see ourselves - Charles Cooley*

Questions such as:
- What do my parents say I am?
- Who do my peers say I am?
- What message is reflected back to me in the faces and voices of the people that influence me (from teachers to parents to store clerks)?
- What do I learn from the media about myself?
- How am I represented by cultures around me?
- Am I missing from the pictures altogether? *if you're the only person in the world, who are you?*
are typically asked subconsciously

This reflection of people in you is one dimensional, everyone, regardless of where they are on the socio-economic class ladder is impacted by this

> All of your other dimensions are mediated (race, gender, sexual orientation, wealth, class, disability) by other people

#### Impact of historical periods on personality

Are you a :
- child of the Great Depression
- survivor of great wars
- product of the Civil Rights era or beneficiary of it
- etc

All historical events change your personality and the **way that you think** in some way
why your elders seem to be different from you, they went through other things

##### At spawn, everyone is the same - its things OUTSIDE of us that shape us into who we are

#### Impact of social contexts on personality

- If you were surrounded by people like yourself OR if you were a minority
- If you grew up speaking English at home OR another language
- If you live in a rural, urban, suburb, or reservation community

**Erik Erikson** mentioned that identity is formed by the process of simultaneous self reflection and observation

A person judges himself based on the way that he thinks other people judge him in comparison to themselves

And those other people then judge themselves based on other people

This happens mostly without thinking except when one feels really good or really bad about themselves

**This is called "identity-consciousness"

This typically happens in Western societies during *puberty*, when coupled with biological changes as well as maturation of cognitive abilities and **raising societal expectations** can introduce the common questions of:

- Who am I now?
- Who was I before?
- Who will I become?

**This is the integration of one's past, present, and future into a singular, cohesive sense of self**

These questions will lead to decisions such as who we will date, what job we will have, where we will live, and what belief system will we embrace

## Multiple Identities
---
There are multiple parts to our identities and most people aren't aware of how complex our own identities are until later in life

Tatum mentions a test she does with her students where they have to fill in the blank with who they are
#### Dominant vs. subordinate groups

She noticed that **students of color, students of a minority group** often mention their racial ethnic group, religion, gender, sexual orientation as their primary identity,

students of a **strong/dominant enclave** mention other attributes outside of their ethnicity, religion,  gender, etc

Dominant groups tend to exhibit ignorance about this element of their identity because of a dominant culture that has persisted for a very long time
- their inner development and outer life is intertwined, which makes that part of their identity escape their consciousness

People that don't fall into the dominant group get set apart and characterized as ***"other"***, which gets reflected by people in our environments, which can be categorized by at least 7 categories:
1. Race/ethnicity
2. Gender
3. Religion
4. Sexual orientation
5. Socioeconomic status
6. Age
7. Physical/mental ability

Most people will find that they fit into at least one of these categories and thus may be subject to being discriminated against 

The **targeted identities** are the ones that we consciously identify because they are at the forefront of attention

The **dominant identities** tend to go unexamined
##### "The mythical norm"

We often have distortions about our differences and dominant identities
## Domination and Subordination
---

The dominant groups get to set the parameters by which the subordinate groups live by
>(who gets the best jobs, who gets validated by society, who's history will get taught in school)

This in turn sets up subordinate groups to seem like they are less capable than dominant groups, which ends up **demoralizing** subordinates
> subordinates internalize what the dominant group reflects back on them and don't trust that they can do what the dominant group does

The dominant group is seen as the norm for humanity

This makes inequality in social relationships normal in the form of:
- jokes about a particular group
- exclusion from communities and opportunities to change the imbalance

Dominant groups don't understand the struggles of the subordinate group because the lives of subordinate groups aren't really shown in the media besides stereotypical depictions

Subordinate groups often have to pay **specific attention to how dominants live** in order to survive because dominants control everything
> abused women have to pay attention to a man's mood in order to survive

##### Subordinate defense against dominant

- Subordinates sometimes can't respond to a dominant's oppressive behavior or else they are at risk of being killed and find that they have to **attend** to the dominant
> Jim Crow and police brutality

	This has the implication of losing oneself and not being able to attend to their own needs (potential unimportance to what they need)

- Subordinates also often reject the world of the dominants because their integrity is not respected

		This can lead to some important skills not being acquired

Some subordinates try to win over the dominants by appeasing to more dominant characteristics (black people whitening their skin, jewish people changing their noses to be more hollywood, etc)

Others can reject that, either way the defense is **extremely physically and mentally taxing**

There is no hierarchy of oppression
