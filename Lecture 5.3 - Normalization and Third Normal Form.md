Database must already be in first and second form

No transitive dependencies - All fields must be only determinable by the primary/composite keys, not by other keys

**A transitive dependency is when there is a dependency between two non primary key attributes** trans = across or in the middle of

3rd form violation:

You can fix this by separating the exam_name and total_marks attributes into a separate table called EXAM and setting exam_name as the primary key that can be linked in the SCORE table

Here, the winner's DOB is dependant on the winner attribute, which is a non primary key attribute. Because of this, it is a **transitive dependancy**

You can fix this by separating the winner and winner's dob attributes into a separate table and set winner as a primary key in a new table and then as a secondary key linked in the initial table
