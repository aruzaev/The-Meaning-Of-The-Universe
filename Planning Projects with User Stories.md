# [[Planning Projects with User Stories]]

A user story is an informal, general explanation of a feature in a piece of software that is written from the perspective of the end user.


The purpose is so articulate how a certain feature will give some sort of value back to the customer, or end user

> the value can be how the feature solves their problem or accomplishes their goal

The **acceptance criteria** is what should be done to achieve their goal or solve their problem

User story - **the why**
Acceptance criteria - **the why**
Actual development during the sprint - **the how**

## Types of User Stories

- Functional user stories - features and functions that directly interact with the users ("as a user, I want to save my shopping cart")
- Non-functional user stories - define qualities of a system (wanting data to be encrypted)
- Technical or infrastructure - about the system itself, not what it provides, written by devs
- constraint stories - any restrictions or limitations (system must support x amount of users)
- business rules - rules that the system must conform to on the business side of things
- user persona - based on specific user personas and their unique needs ("as a new user i want a tutorial")
- epic user stories - very large stories that need to be broken down to smaller parts (if you want a dashboard, what are the sub stories that are a part of that dashboard?)
- spike user stories - used to create a proof of concept or research (research  ways to integrate with x component)
