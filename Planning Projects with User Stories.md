# [[Planning Projects with User Stories]]

A user story is an informal, general explanation of a feature in a piece of software that is written from the perspective of the end user.


The purpose is so articulate how a certain feature will give some sort of value back to the customer, or end user

> the value can be how the feature solves their problem or accomplishes their goal

The **acceptance criteria** is what should be done to achieve their goal or solve their problem

User story - **the why**
Acceptance criteria - **the why**
Actual development during the sprint - **the how**
