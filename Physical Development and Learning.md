# [[Physical Development and Learning]]

## The Neonate

Neonates are babies that are up to one month old

They have built in responses to stimuli needed to survive in the world (sucking, swallowing, coughing, and blinking)

They can also move their arms or legs away from painful stimulus

Their actions at this stage are purely involuntary but as they grow older they become more voluntary of the higher brain centers

## Perceptual Development in Infancy

Newborn babies already have preferences for odors, tastes, sounds, and visual configurations
Newborns can turn their heads where sound is and prefer female voices (such as their mother's)

The favor sweet tastes and can differentiate between salty, bitter, and sour things
They are receptive to pain and stroking

### Vision

Newborns can't see well until they are 2 years old

Until then, they can mainly focus on object 20 cm away 
They can also identify between a strange female face and their mother's 
They can discriminate depth

## Learning in Infancy

They use *habituation* to learn new things

When shown a new stimulus, they become quieter and are fixated on the thing
When they are used to the stimulus, they become habituated and lose interest in that thing
They still remember that thing but they prefer the new stimulus

## Physical and Motor Development

There are two significant stages in motor development:
- infancy
- adolescence

These changes can happen either through maturation (growing up naturally according to your own biological table) or learning
### Infancy

This stage mostly depends on maturation and many actions such as sitting, standing, and walking occur because of **growth of the central nervous system**

The rate of these milestones can be stunted due to malnutrition or a lack of a mom or sensory deprivation

Physical and motor development usually occur top down (babies learn how to lift their heads before they know how to sit, and sit before they can walk)

### Adolescence and Puberty

Adolescence begins with puberty (7-14 for girls and 9-16 for boys) and culminates in sexual maturity

When puberty happens to people is up to their own biological timetable, which is hereditary but some environmental factors can come in play

This period also causes growth spurts, which is an accelerated growth rate 
> different parts of the body grow at different rates which is why they could look awkward

Boys begin to grow hair and girl's bodies become more developed

First ejaculation and menstruation 

### Middle Age

Women get menopause, which is when they don't have periods (occurs between 45 and 55)

This means that they cannot have kids anymore

There can be some psychological problems like irritability and anxiety but most women don't get these things

Men experience a gradual decline in their testosterone levels from 20 years old until 60
Reduction of sex drive and semen production

Sperm has fragmentation in the DN
