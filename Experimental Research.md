# [[Experimental Research]]

This is the use of an experimental condition and a control condition to test the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable

A **variable** is a characteristic that can take on different values, such as:

- height
- age
- temperature
- test scores

These variables are used to test [[cause and effect]] relationships, therefore:

- The **independent variable** is the cause. Its value is independent of other variables in the study
- The **dependent variable** is the effect. Its value depends on changes in the independent variable

An example of the two is as follows:

- The **independent variable** is the temperature of the room. In a study, you can change the temperature of the room and make it cooler for half the participants and warmer for the other half
- The **dependent** variable is the math test scores. You can measure the math skills of participants using a test to determine if the temperature of the room influences them

From these variables, two research ==independent variable== participant groups are created:

- The **experiment** condition receives the treatment
- The **control** condition does not receive treatment (they are the anchor to see the difference in the dependent variable, if any, the treatment creates)
