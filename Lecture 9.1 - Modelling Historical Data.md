Discuss the factors that influence the decision to model historical data
create a new entity to track historical data
define UID for this new historical tracker entity

Most businesses tend to track historical data in order to find trends and patterns that can help them improve their product/service

**Historical data** - data that records changes over time
**Audit trail** - a step by step record of data changes 

You need to ask your client that you're building a database for their requirements for storing historical data such as:
- is an audit trail required?
- can attribute values change over time or are they constant?
- can relationships change over time?
- do you need to produce reports on older data?
- do you need to keep previous versions?
