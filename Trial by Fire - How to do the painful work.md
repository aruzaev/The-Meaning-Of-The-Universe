# [[Trial by Fire - How to do the painful work]]

Things to cover:

- The Wall of Fire
- The Nature of Resistance
- Slaying the Dragon
- Eating Pain
- The Generals' Perspective

If you can understand the nature of why you procrastinate or avoid hard work, it becomes simpler to understand

The universe is going to test you and things can get really ugly, you need to face the fire

## Trial by Fire

Every action has an opposite and equal reaction

Heaven cannot exist without hell, everything works in a duality
They key to heaven is by visiting hell and **life is suffering**

You can't gain success without your past trying to pull you down

The universe will always resist your efforts grow (it's metal and is hard to bend, every day you have to try to bend the bar, through the strength of holding it, you can mold the universe to whatever you want)
> it requires strength to hold it there before it solidifies

Success is painful, pain is the universal law of human and is the reason why we have evolved so much (we got eaten so much before we learned to fought back)

The law of attraction is bullshit and the universe is actually not on you side

If you are worried about the pain, the best thing that you can do for yourself is to face the pain 

**The only thing standing in between you and the goal is A LOT OF SUFFERING**, there is no other way of going about it 

**You need to teach yourself how to suffer well**

## The Wall of Fire

If you want to get to where you want to be, you're going to have to go through a wall of fire, progress **is not linear or easy**

Pain is your best friend, we don't want to hate them or despise them, we want to live, breathe, and eat them

**Pain is the only way that you can achieve what you want/you goals**

The only way to get what you want is to not go around pain or pretend that it isn't there, but to go through the wall of fire 

You can only deserve what you want if you've been through the process of going through the pain to get what you want

One you complete the Trial by Fire, the universe will reward you with what you want, but only after you did the trial

I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO HURT !!!!!!!

The worst thing to do **is have delusion and think you're going to breeze through life**

You won't know how long you have to sit in the fire for, but if you get out you will be reset all the way to the start

The fire represents:
- discomfort
- anxiety
- fear
- doubt
- other negative emotions

It is remarkable how **much pain a person could go through before they break**

I'm like a piece of metal that is being molded into a sword by a blacksmith with tons of pain and fire before I can come out sharp and ready to fight

### How do we get the courage to walk through the fire every day?

You have the human spirit; you have generations of blood coursing through your veins that can face pain and thrive

## The Nature of Resistance

Resistance is true enemy of your goal and you have to face it everyday

If you understand the nature of it, you can learn how to beat it

It is THE THING that says that keeps you from achieving your goals

It is **the little voice in your brain** that tells you:
- you're weak
- you aren't good/smart enough
- you aren't motivated enough to accomplish the things that you want to do

It is a faceless and formless demon in your brain that only exists for the sole purpose of leading you away from your goals and never starting to become your true self

Sisyphus picture - its not the rock, the gravity, or the incline of the mountain
> **its the fears that the person pushing the rock up the mountain might feel**

It's never the actions that make you feel that resistance, its the fact that those actions make you realize it contributes to our goals where that resistance comes in

For programming:

1. **Breaking Down the Objective Action**: Just like sales is broken down into actions like dialing a number and pressing a button, programming can be broken down into smaller, objective actions. Writing code, debugging, testing, and deploying are all discrete steps that don't inherently involve emotional resistance. They are simply tasks that need to be completed.
    
2. **Understanding Subjective Resistance**: The fear or resistance one might feel when approaching a complex programming problem is not a product of the programming itself. It's a subjective response, potentially based on a fear of failure, not being good enough, or not knowing enough.
    
3. **Overcoming Psychological Barriers**: Just as the text suggests confronting the resistance in sales by rationalizing the action, in programming, one can confront their own psychological barriers by focusing on the problem-solving aspect rather than the emotional response. This means approaching each programming challenge as a series of logical steps that need to be taken, rather than an insurmountable problem.
    
4. **Incremental Progress**: Just as sales calls are made one at a time, programming problems can be solved incrementally. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and tackle them one at a time.
    
5. **Practice and Familiarity**: The more you engage in the act of programming, just as with making sales calls, the more familiar it becomes. Over time, the subjective resistance decreases as the actions become more routine and less daunting.
    
6. **Mindset Shift**: Shift your mindset from seeing problems as threats to viewing them as opportunities to learn and improve your skills. Each problem solved adds to your experience and makes you a better problem solver.
    
7. **Reflection and Learning**: After each programming task, reflect on what you learned, what could have been done better, and how you approached the problem. This reflection can help you understand your resistance and develop strategies to overcome it in the future.

Start seeing the activities you resist for what they are, NOT WHO YOU ARE. They will get easier and less daunting.

### The Principles of Resistance

**Principle 1**: There is an enemy working against you, **resistance**. It's intelligent, malevolent and nasty.
**Principle 2**: The enemy is relentless. It aims to kill your desired reality & quash all your hopes and dreams.
**Principle 3**: The enemy is produced by a fragment of you. It's inside you, and it comes from you.
**Principle 4**: You are **not** the enemy. It's a force of nature produced by you, but you can't help it. Just like a pulse.
**Principle 5**: You **must duel** yourself. You are the knight AND the dragon. War is inevitable. The knight must win.
**Principle 6**: Goals come first, resistance comes second. There cannot be a shadow without an object and the sun. 
> Every action has a reaction, you can't have goals without feeling resistance to them and visa versa

**Principle 7**: Resistance can be overcome with pain, love, and assistance (the opposite of resistance). It's beatable

### How can we see resistance?

We only have to look as far as our emotions, thoughts, fears, and desires

We can't see resistance, **but we can see how it manifests**

**Resistance is the universe's universal form of currency to prevent change**

Most common forms of resistance:
- Lack of self love (it makes you feel stupid and hate yourself) !!!
- Self-loathing (not working because you hate yourself or your situation (you think you don't deserve to work because you're in a bad situation, you're not worth the effort, etc)) !!!
- Identity (not working because "that wouldn't be me") !!!
- Routine  (not working because you "didn't sleep very well" or "didn't have coffee") !!!
- Entitlement (not working because you're entitled and you think the work is beneath you)
- Fear (**most common** not working because you're afraid what will happen if you do) !!!
- Judging !!!
- Burnout (not working because you think you're burned out, this is a real thing but it takes months of insane grinding to even remotely get to that point, humans are resilient) !!!
- Opinions (not working because someone told you to take a break or not to ) !!!!!
- Uncertainty (not working because you're not sure how) !!!!
- Pain avoidance (not working because work HURTS) !!!
- Instant gratification (not working because you are too used to getting instant dopamine hits)!!!
- Doubt (you have doubts about yourself or if what you want is possible) !!!
- Anxiety  (not working because it makes you feel nervous, anxious, or uncomfortable) !!!
- Rationalisation (you've rationalized yourself to not do them)
- Learning (not working because you want to learn more about it first)
- Comfort (not working because you feel comfortable right now and don't want to feel uncomfortable) !!!!!!!!
- Research - not working because you want to learn more about it before you do it
- Perfection (not working because you want everything to be perfect before starting) !!!!!!!!
- Waiting (not working because you would rather wait to see if things change)
- Justifying (not working because you justified and deluded yourself not to work)
- Warped Priorities (not working on the main thing because you think you should be working on something else, "oh i should finish my website instead of doing my homework") !!!!!!
- Distraction (not working because that thing (youtube) keeps distracting you) !!!
- Lack of Support (not working because you think you need support or an accountability partner)
- Feeling Vulnerable (not working because it makes you feel stupid which makes you feel vulnerable) !!!!!!!
- Addiction (not working because you're addicted to something other than working (porn, video games))!!!
- Criticism (not working because you criticized others for doing work, or judging people for working hard) !!!
- Denial  (not working because you're in denial)
- Drama (not working because you're drawn to creating drama in your life or because you create it)
- Procrastination (not working because you're putting it off until tomorrow) !!!

"Not doing the work" = not doing what you KNOW you SHOULD be doing (can be anything)

The first step is **awareness**, then comes *intolerance*

![[Pasted image 20240209234403.png]]

All of these things are the same thing (resistance), it's just manifesting in different ways
