# [[Lecture 9.4 - Drawing Conventions for Readability]]

Convention make things easier for us as they tell us what to expect and help us behave differently

As an ERD becomes more complicated and bigger, we can use one of **two** drawing conventions that would make it easier to layout:

1. Placing high volume entities towards the top left of the page
2. Placing high volume entities towards the bottom right of the page

Choosing the convention isn't important, it is important to be consistent in your choice though

Entities that are **high volume** are typically the *central* entities that have a lot of relationships, the highest of all the other entities

Most of the business logic and rules will be stored in these entities

When high volume entities are on the upper left portion of the diagram, the crows feet will point south and east

When the high volume entities are on the lower right portion, the crows feet will point north and west

## Clarity is Key

Clarity and readability are the most important parts of the ERD and you shouldn't let convention interfere with readability

To ensure clarity in an ERD, make sure to:
- avoid crossing relationship lines
- avoid entities that overlap
- avoid relationship lines that cross entities
- use plenty of white space (keep the entities further away so they're not cluttered)
- split larger erds into sub diagrams
