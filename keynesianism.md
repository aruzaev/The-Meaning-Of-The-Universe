Let's start with predecessors and then Keynes himself.  
Classical economists stated that markets are efficient (as in, demand-supply will perfectly match, all will get a fair price) and whatever imperfections we see are a matter of short run only. They believed that "everything will be perfect in the long run".

John Maynard Keynes was from a famous family. His father was already a big shot economist. In 1919, Keynes wrote a visionary book "Economic Consequences of Peace", in which he criticised the Versailles Treaty for the demand it imposed on Germany. He was right, as Hitler cashed on that situation. Keynes also worked in the India office in London. He was an excellent statistician and emphasised for a better data collection from India. He was one of the two architects of the Bretton Woods System as well.

Anyhow, he became famous for his magnum opus "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money". He rejected the classical notion of perfect markets in long-run and famously commented that "How long is long run? The only thing true about long run is that we all are dead!". This was the beginning of what came to be known as the Keynesian Economics (KE henceforth).

The essence of KE is that markets on their own will not come to balance because there are rigidities. For example, people lack foresight, they resist change, prefect information doesn't exist, and they will also behave unethically for private gains. This gave rise to a different understanding of the world.

Economics got divided between micro and macro, as the behavior of variables changes when taken as aggregates. Fiscal policy gained importance and labor market became a matter of greater interest. New theories of interest and wages were proposed. KE also gave the most debated, used, and abused idea. That intervention and investment by government are a must to break a vicious cycle of [low capital formation -> low production -> low wages -> low savings -> low capital formation].

This idea was the foundation of Roosevelt's New Deal as well as Obama's response post-2008 crisis. Although KE suggests that governments should intervene at times of crisis or to break the vicious cycle of low investment only, and in that sense, he is very much in sync with the standard capitalist theory with government as a regulator, his work has been misused by leftists to pitch for government intervention and control at all times.

KE was the mainstay of economic thought from 1930s to 1950s. Thereafter, Milton Friedman and the Chicago School established the neo-classical school. It was classical thought, updated with role of government, imperfection, regulations, and developmental concerns. KE shot back to prominence during 2008 crisis with Paul Krugman as the flagbearer. However, KE has again been misinterpreted and hijacked by the anti-right propagandists rather than sincere
