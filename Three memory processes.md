# [[Three memory processes]]

1. Encoding
2. Storage
3. Retrieval 

## Encoding
---
The way in which a memory is converted into something that can be stored in the brain

The memory can be stored in the **short-term** or **long-term**

In order for the process of encoding to start, the person must exercise **selective attention** which is ignoring all of the irrelevant information that surrounds them


e.x. If your partner asks you to get bread from the store, you need to focus on what your partner is saying rather than the tv playing or the notifications on your phone making noise

## Storage 
---
The process of keeping or maintaining information in memory

In order for memories to be stored, a physiological change called **consolidation** needs to occur

**Consolidation** is a process that involves physiological and biochemical changes that occur automatically unless the person loses consciousness abruptly (being involved in a car crash and not remembering what happened)

Sleep is very important in this process

## Retrieval
---
Occurs when information stored in memory is brough to consciousness

If you fail to remember, then one of the processes above was disrupted
