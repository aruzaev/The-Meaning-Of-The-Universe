# [[Three systems of memory]]

There are three, interacting systems of memory:

1. Sensory
2. Short-term
3. Long-term

## Sensory
---

Sensory memory is the process of processing all of the millions of tiny bits of information that a person processes every minute

A lot of that memory gets forgotten quickly:
- visual memory is held for a fraction of a second
- sound memory is held for about two seconds

It's useful because it keeps whatever you see from disappearing whenever you blink

XBDF letter study, people could recall the letters perfectly immediately after but then they faded very quickly from memory

## Short-term
---
Short-term memory includes your thoughts, when you have a conversation, solving a problem, and looking up a phone number and it remembering it long enough to dial it

STM doesn't receive stimuli like sensory memory does, instead it **codes** information

This can be done:
- through sound (letter "T" is coded as the sound "tee" and not the shape "T") OR
- through visual images in semantic form (with meaning)

Short-term memory has a very limited capacity at around **5-9 items** 

Items in STM are usually lost within 30 seconds unless we repeat them over and over again in the form of a **rehearsal**

STM is very fragile and any distraction can lose it forever (why you sometimes forget what you were saying)

This is the constant repetition of something in the short term memory to prolong its stay in the brain

#### STM as working memory

**Working memory** is a subsystem of memory that acts as a mental workspace where you can work on information to understand it, remember it, or use it to solve a problem

It's an erasable blackboard that allows you to hold information for a brief moment to manipulate it and understand it

The prefrontal cortex is plays an important role in this

##### Memory strategies

The work involved is sometimes important processes called **memory strategies**
