# [[Three systems of memory]]

There are three, interacting systems of memory:

1. Sensory
2. Short-term
3. Long-term

## Sensory

Sensory memory is the process of processing all of the millions of tiny bits of information that a person processes every minute

A lot of that memory gets forgotten quickly:
- visual memory is held for a fraction of a second
- sound memory is held for about two seconds

It's useful because it keeps whatever you see from disappearing whenever you blink

XBDF letter study, people could recall the letters perfectly immediately after but then they faded very quickly from memory

## Short-term
---
Short-term memory includes your thoughts, when you have a conversation, solving a problem, and looking up a phone number and it remembering it long enough to dial it

STM doesn't receive stimuli like sensory memory does, instead it **codes** information

This can be done:
- through sound (letter "T" is coded as the sound "tee" and not the shape "T") OR
- through visual images in semantic form (with meaning)

Short-term memory has a very limited capacity at around **5-9 items** 

Items in STM are usually lost within 30 seconds unless we repeat them over and over again in the form of a **rehearsal**

STM is very fragile and any distraction can lose it forever (why you sometimes forget what you were saying)

This is the constant repetition of something in the short term memory to prolong its stay in the brain

#### STM as working memory

**Working memory** is a subsystem of memory that acts as a mental workspace where you can work on information to understand it, remember it, or use it to solve a problem

It's an erasable blackboard that allows you to hold information for a brief moment to manipulate it and understand it

The prefrontal cortex is plays an important role in this

##### Memory strategies

The work involved is sometimes important processes called **memory strategies**

Rote rehearsal isn't a good way to remember things 
- this is called *shallow* processing which is encoding things based on the sound of a word

A better way is with *deep* processing (encoding based on the meaning of the info), the deeper the processing is, the better it gets remembered in long term memory
- one strat is by relating the new information to information you already know really well
- these types of strategies are called *elaboration strategies*

## Long-term
---
Holds all the knowledge we've gained, skills, and memories

Information in LTM is usually stored in semantic form

There are two subsystems of LTM:

- declarative memory
- non-declarative memory

### Declarative Memory
---
Also called *explicit memory*

Stored facts, information, and personal life events that can be remembered verbally or with images

There are two types of declarative memory:

- episodic memory
- semantic memory

#### Episodic Memory

is the memory of events that we experienced personally like:

- people that we have known
- places we've seen
- personal experiences we've had

This is a mental diary of the episodes of our lives

#### Semantic Memory

is the memory for general knowledge, objective facts, and information

its our mental dictionary of stored knowledge like:

> 1 + 1 = 2

### Non-Declarative Memory
---
Also called *implicit memory*

Consists of:
- motor skills
- habits
- classically conditioned responses

Motor skills occur through repeated practice and are learned slowly, but once learned they become habit and can be carried out with no conscious effort
