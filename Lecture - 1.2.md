[[Database Concepts & Design]]

In IT, it is important to understand how data is modelled and stored in a database

## Data vs. Information
---

**Data**: Raw or unprocessed content (A list of names that have no meaning to them or title or order)
**Information**: A certain piece of data that has a special meaning or function

Information is received from data by combining, comparing, analyzing, or performing calculations on raw data

When a user uses a website, pieces of data (cookies i think ???) are collected

Data = a numbered score that each student receives from a standardized test
Information = the school's average score or the state's average score

Oracle database helps transform raw data and stats into useful pieces of information

## What is a Database?

It is a centralized and structured set of data stored on a computer

You can retrieve data, add new data, and modify and delete existing elements easily and when needed

You can also transform the raw data into useful information

Managed by a database administrator

#### Documents, Pictures, Video, Sound

Modern databases support a wide variety of documents such as sound, video, and text files

The data is stored in its raw form

When the raw data is retrieved from the database, it becomes useful information
