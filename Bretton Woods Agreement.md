# [[Bretton Woods Agreement]]

The [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] was an agreement made in 1944 by 44 allied nations to use the [[gold standard]] to create a fixed currency exchange rate

Also established the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank

The Breton Woods System is a set of rules to provide the framework for fixed international currency exchange rates

Each country in the agreement would be responsible in upholding the exchange rate with very narrow margins

Countries that had trouble doing that asked the IMF for a rate adjustment, which all the other countries would follow 

The agreement ended when RIchard Nixon suspended the US' reliance on the gold standard because certain political events were undermining US industries
