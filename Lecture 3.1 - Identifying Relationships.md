# [[Lecture 3.1 - Identifying Relationships]]

Being able to identify the relationships between entities will make it easier to understand how different pieces of data are connected

and

how different parts of a business system can affect each other

e.x. the relationship between a student and a book is that the student checks out the book and the book is being checked out by a student


To accurately model business requirements, the act of defining relationships is just as important as the entities themselves

## Relationships in Families

A relationship is when two or more people or things are connected in some way

For families, they are connected by blood and the relationships are defined between people like mother, father, aunt, and cousin

The name of the relationship tells us how the family is connected

## Relationships in Data Models

Relationships represent something of significance or importance to the business 

They are bidirectional ways that show how entities are related to one another and they have the following things:

- names at both ends
- optionality
- cardinality

## Optionality

The differentiator between if a relationship is mandatory or optional

e.x. Is a relationship between entities EMPLOYEE and JOB mandatory?

It depends on the business but sometimes job titles exist where there isn't any employees to fill the position yet and thats okay

## Cardinality

The measurement of the quantity of something

Determines the degree to which one entity is related to each other

"How many?"

e.x. how many jobs can one employee hold at a company? Usually the answer is one

Cardinality answers whether the number in the relationship is singular or plural, not the specific number
