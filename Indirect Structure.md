# [[Indirect Structure]]

You build *towards* the purpose of the message by:
- first providing the background
- technical details
- or reasons that lead to a specific situation or recommendation

The main information is only revealed after contributing factors or rationale or explanation has been explained with detail

**This doesn't mean that you can be vague or unclear, this simply means that the ==structure== is indirect**

Some situations where this can be used:

- the company's policy is using indirect structure
- the reader may be resistant to what the writer may say
- the reader may be surprised or upset by the message

### Background 

Explain context that orients the reader:
- explain the history of a situation or project
- provide an overview of a topic or issue
- discuss needs or criteria for evaluation

### Technical Details/Analysis

Writer provides all the detailed information that the reader might need. It should provide the foundation for the next section, purpose. We do this by explaining, analyzing, and legitimizing the it before hand:
- Provide full specs for a technology
- Explain reasons fore a decision or request
- Indicate a schedule or proposal or plan
- Analyze options fully to give a recommendation
- Evaluate the feasibility of a solution

### Purpose

The logical conclusion to the information that has just been provided, do this only after technical details and analysis
- If purpose is to inform the reader, provide the most important content
- If it is to request, ask clearly and politely for answers or actions
- If it is to persuade, recommend or evaluate then indicate your stance 

### Close

Conclude the message. This may achieve a few goals:
- Provide a mechanism for feedback
- showcase a positive tone
