# [[Lecture 2.3 - Entity Relationship Model]]

An entity relationship diagram is a graphical representation of a database that illustrates the entities in a database and the relationships between them.

Its main function is as a blueprint that **translates business rules** and requirements for a database into a **structured framework** that can be easily **understood and communicated**





A good data model stays the same regardless of the type of DB the system is built upon

This model is called "implementation-free" and will stay the same even if a data base isn't used at all

## What is an Entity Relationship Model



It is a list of all entities, their attributes, and the relationships between the entities

It provides background information such as entity descriptions, data types, and constraints
