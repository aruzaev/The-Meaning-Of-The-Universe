# [[Lecture 2.3 - Entity Relationship Model]]

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a tool that allows for consistent and specific mapping of the data requirements of a business regardless of the software used for the physical implementation of the DB

A good data model stays the same regardless of the type of DB the system is built upon

This model is called "implementation-free" and will stay the same even if a data base isn't used at all

## What is an Entity Relationship Model

It is a list of all entities, their attributes, and the relationships between the entities

It provides background information such as entity descriptions, data types, and constraints
