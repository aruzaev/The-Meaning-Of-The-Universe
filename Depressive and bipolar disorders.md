# [[Depressive and bipolar disorders]]

Mood disorders are when there are intense and unwanted emotions

There are two categories of mood disorders:

- depressive
- bipolar

## Major Depressive Disorder

People with MDD tend to have a persistent overwhelming sadness, despair, hopelessness,  and lose the ability to enjoy things or experience pleasure

They may also have appetite or weight changes (either eating too much or too little), sleep disturbances, loss of energy, and difficulty concentrating

Symptoms can also include psychomotor (movement in conscious mental activity) movement:
- body movement and speech are so slow it seems like they are in slow motion
- or the opposite; constantly pacing and fidgeting

If severe enough, depression can even induce hallucinations and delusions (psychotic depression)

Depression impacts people of all social statuses, cultures, and nations. It is the **most common**mental disorder

Females (especially adolescent girls) are **twice as likely** to have depression than males (except Jews, where men are more likely)

Women are more **likely to put the needs of others ahead of their own**

Some patients only have one major depressive episode but there's a 50-60% chance that there will be a recurrence (especially people that felt depression before 20 and ppl with family history of mood disorders)

Women are one and a half times more likely to be **hospitalized**

20%-30% of people's depressive episodes are chronic, lasting two years or longer

Many people with depression **don't receive treatment**

Depression causes more than half of all suicide attempts and **15% of people with depression will kill themselves**

Many people also have ***persistent depressive disorder*** which is a milder form of depression (fewer symptoms than MDD) but still chronic (two years or longer)

## Preventing Suicide

The methods, reasons, and warning signs are very similar across all cultures, even if the rates are different

Many people who want to commit suicide voice their intent either verbally:

- "You won't be seeing me again"
- "You won't have to worry about me anymore"
- "Life isn't worth living"

or behaviorally:

- giving away their most valued possessions
- withdrawing from friends, family, and acquaintances
- showing personality changes
- acting and looking depressed
- losing interest in favorite activities

Suicidal individuals need compassion, emotional support, and the opportunity to say what's bothering them and their feelings

## Seasonal Depression

People that have seasonal affective disorder (SAD) experience depression that depends on the current season

The most common type is **winter depression** and is triggered by **light deficiency** because the days are shorter

People become very depressed, start sleeping and eating more

Light treatment works well

## Bipolar Disorder

When people experience two radically opposite moods (extreme highs, mania and extreme lows, major depression) with normal periods in between

**Manic episode** - excessive euphoria, inflated self esteem or ego, wild optimism, hyperactivity

These episodes make people so wound up and full of energy that they rarely sleep, always engaged in a bunch of activities at once, talk loud and fast, and skip from one topic to the other

They lose touch with reality temporarily

They may go on wild spending sprees and if someone tries to talk them out of it they get defensive, hostile, and even dangerous

They often become hospitalized in other to protect them and other people from their antics

Bipolar is much less common than depression (under 1% suffer from it)

90% of people with bipolar have frequent episodes 

70%-80% of people return to **normal after their episodes** and can manage their symptoms and live a normal life with drugs like **lithium and divalproex**

Psychotherapy can also help cope with the stress

## Causes of Depressive Disorders and Bipolar Disorders

### The Biological Perspective

Genetic inheritance and abnormal brain chemistry play a major role

### The Role of Genetic Inheritance

People that have depression are more likely to pass it down to their relatives (due to genetic factors instead of environmental)

Heritability of major depression is 38% (women 42% and men 29%)

The genetic link is much stronger with bipolar than depression (20x times greater chance of inheritance with first degree relatives)

### The Role of Serotonin and Norepinephrine

Our moods are altered by our body's biochemicals, including neurotransmitters

**Norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine*** play an important role in mood disorder

These neurotransmitters work in the **limbic system and hypothalamus** which are the parts that **regulate emotional behavior**

Some people think that mood disorders result in biochemical changes, instead of the different biochemistry resulting in mood disorders

### The Cognitive Perspective

Depression could be caused by distortions in thinking

Depressed people see themselves, the world, and their future negatively

Interactions with the world are defeating (there are burdens and obstacles that end in failure)

They believe that they are worthless and assign their failures to their own inadequacies

They also think that their future holds no hope:
- "Everything always turns out wrong"
- "I never win"
- "Things will never get better"
- "It's no use"
