# [[Week 1 - C]]

Machine code is basically binary, which is the only things computers understand

We write in *source code* which needs to be converted to *machine code* via a *compiler*

Code needs to adhere to three princples:

1. correctness (if it runs)
2. design (subjective, the better its design the faster it runs)
3. style (how pretty and readable it is)

Most IDEs have syntax highlighting

You put a semicolon after a statement, not all lines need a semicolon

The \n is an *escape sequence*

Header files exist because computers used to be very weak and if all libraries were available it would make c very slow
