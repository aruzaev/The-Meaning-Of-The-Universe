# [[Globalization - an overview]]
---

Refers to a worldwide partnership of economies, cultures, ideas, goods, and resources from around the world, **global village**

**Advocates** of it say it's good because it allows goods, money, and labor to flow freely between countries without the interference of physical borders and governments

This in turn connects people together and stimulates economic growth worldwide

**Critics** say that it can lead to uncontrolled capitalism which allows multinational conglomerates to displace local companies and *create a bigger gap between the wealthy and the poor*

## The History of Globalization
---

Many scholars agree that globalization has occurred many times throughout history when **domestic policies conflicted with the international economic state**
> severe protectionist laws after both World Wars (per capita income growth dropped below 1% and FDIs plummeted)

After WW2, the fall of tariffs and protectionist laws boosted the international exchange of goods

International trade tripled between 1980 and 1999

The creation of the WTO and the IMF and the World Bank and the EU helped accelerate foreign trade through **multinational networks**

## Globalization Issues in the Environment
---

Globalization also creates social, political, economical, and environmental **disruptions**

Western industries have now started to **off-shore** labor (sending work to developing countries for cheaper labor/employment costs)

**Western countries like Canada and the US have higher production costs because of a higher minimum wage and currency rate**

Canadian wages are also affected by **unions**, which protect the employees and give them higher wages
> The min wage in China is between $1.90 - $3.80 while Canada's is between $10.50 - $13.00

**Offshoring has lead to Western factories shutting down which eliminated jobs in these countries**

Corporations are able to exploit a lack of unions, worker's protections (through safe work environments, and ethical work hours), and tiny min wages in developing countries 

China estimates that over $40 billion is lost per year due to occupational disease, injuries, and death

This is because corporations that pollute a lot offshore because developing countries have lax environmental regulations compared to western ones

**Environmental issues in one location on earth will impact other locations (e.x. climate change)**

in 1999, people voiced their concerns via protest outside the WTO meeting, which is an organization that mandates and regulates international trade

Their protests were against the impact of free trade on developing and developed countries and the environment and human rights

People argue that the **major economic organizations like the WTO, World Bank, and IMF create a world were capitalism and corporate interests are more important than human rights and protecting the environment**


## Globalization Issues in Politics/Economy
---

It's undeniable that globalization has impacted the international economy and politics for generations to come

The 2008 financial crisis in the US impacted nearly every country in the world, including Canada
> the price of real estate plummeted, even though Canadian real estate structure is different

There were a lot of bailouts (government support to a failing company) to save the world's economy from total collapse

This event proved to some that globalization **has inherent problems in a global system built upon financial codependency**

Advocates say that once the damage of the event has settled, the global economy will be strengthened and more reliable

## Globalization Today
---

The financial crisis brought to light the public debate of the widening income inequality gap  across the world

Critics say that **globalization helps the rich get richer and the working class and poor people get poorer**
> 2001-2013 the median pay of a Canadian CEO went from $1.4 million to $5.6 million
> 
> Before, investment opportunities were more accessible to the middle class but now only the top 10% of earners generated 57% of total investment income

The Canadian government is taking steps to re-negotiate trade agreements with Asian countries and anticipates that the CFKTA will boost Canadian competiveness in Asia and will boost the economy

**Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)** would've greatly expanded Canada's exports of beef, seafood, dairy, and wine to the Pacific rim countries but Trump pulled out of it before it could be enacted

The partnership still exists, but without the USA participating, the profits are significantly smaller
