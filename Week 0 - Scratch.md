Problem solving is about input --> blackbox --> output

Transistors are tiny switches that are like light bulbs, they have an on (1) and off (0) state

Computers use a base-2 system (2^2, 2^1, 2^0)

We use bytes, which is 8 bits or 8 numbers or switches (00000000)

We use [[ASCII]] to map binary numbers to letters, starting with 65 (A)
- to represent the number 1, you use other numbers like 49

Its better to use [[Unicode]] is like [[ASCII]] but uses 32 bits instead of 8 and allows for characters from other countries and emojis, allows for trillions of characters

Emojis are just characters and characters have fonts, which is why emojis on different phones can look differently

Those triple emojis are just combinations of three unicode emojis which allow for endless possibilities 

[[Abstraction]] essentially can make the final result look more complicated than the implementation (i.e oscar the grouch game costume change)

Functions are just algorithms that have been implemented in a program

some functions can have a return value, which gets used whenever you want to by another function
