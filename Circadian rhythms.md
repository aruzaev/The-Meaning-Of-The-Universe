# [[Circadian rhythms]]

This is your 24-hour internal clock that regulates cycles of alertness and sleepiness, this is mostly done via the **change in light** in our environment

The following bodily functions follow circadian rhythms:

- blood pressure
- heart rate
- appetite
- secretion of hormones
- digestive enzymes
- sensory acuity (ability to be aware of a person's details in front of you)
- your body's response to medication
