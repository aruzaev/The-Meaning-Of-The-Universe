# Systems Planning

put focus on the most minute details - info can come from the client
- not interactive - rfp (what their business reqs are) - other exiisting docs  (about old systems etc)
- interactive methods - surveys, forms, interviews, JAD sessions (good for rapid development, usually done on site, no one allowed to leave until solved)

attitude to resolve
sincere observation(obtrusive vs unobtrusive)

## Interviewing

we always need to prepare a  questionnare

we cant give the survey to everyone,  get target audience and sample thhem

clear questions, open and closed
