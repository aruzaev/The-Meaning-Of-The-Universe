# [[Does the Internet Make You Smarter or Dumber]]

"*To be everywhere is to be nowhere*" - Seneca

A growing number of research suggests that the internet is making us into *scattered* and *superficial* thinkers

Studies show that:
- people who read texts with a bunch of links in it comprehend less than traditional text readers
- people that watch videos remember less than people that take in information in a more focused manner (like text?)
- people that are distracted by texts, emails, and other notifications understand less than people that can concentrate
- people who try to multitask are less creative and productive than people who do one thing at a time

All of these issues come from *dividing your attention*; when giving a new piece of information your full attention you are able to ***meaningfully and systematically associate it with knowledge already well established in memory***

These associations are crucial to learning difficult things

When your attention is constantly *interrupted* by other things such as notifications, our brains are **unable** to form the strong connections that give depth to your understanding of a concept

The information is disjointed and scattered and is easily forgettable

A few studies have been done to see how different media affects our brains:

1. One study says that playing video games enhanced [[visual literacy]] skills, increasing the speed that people can focus from one image on a screen to another. However other studies show that this level of visual processing results in **more automatic** thinking
2. Another study showed that people who had their internet connected laptops shut during a lecture did much better than people that browsed the internet

Thus, it can be concluded that all pieces of media develops some cognitive skills while making other skills worse

Our *visual-spatial* intelligence might be stronger, but our abilities in higher order cognitive functions such as:
- abstract vocabulary
- mindfulness
- reflection
- [[inductive problem solving]]
- critical thinking
- imagination

It's also been tested that **multitaskers** performed poorly in cognitive tasks and had the following characteristics:
- more distractable
- less control over their attention
- much less able to distinguish important info from trivia !!!
- ***they weren't even good at multitasking***
