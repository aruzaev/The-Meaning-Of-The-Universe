# [[Difference between SDLC and Methodology]]

**SDLC stands for:***
- Systems
- Development
- Life
- Cycle

## What is SDLC

It is a life cycle, which is a **framework** that describes the activities done at each stage of the software development process

**All *systems*** have a life cycle or series of changes/stages that they will naturally go through

The amount of stages and the names of them always change, but the primary stages are common:
- **conception**
- **development**
- **maturity**
- **decline

## Methodologies

Since an SDLC refers to the stages that all systems **naturally** undergo

A methodology is an approach **invented by humans** to manage the events naturally occurring in the SDLC

A methodology is a set of steps, guidelines, activities, and/or principles to follow in a particular situation
