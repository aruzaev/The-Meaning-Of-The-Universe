- Online misinformation has fueled the spread of conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic and the vaccines.
- Some people, like Rebekah, a 24-year-old survivor of domestic abuse, became followers of anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine movements after reading an Instagram post that made them distrust the mainstream media.
- Conspiracy theories are recycled from one epidemic to another, and reflect larger societal concerns and anxieties.
- Conspiracy theories can undermine public health efforts and erode trust in science and institutions.
- One way to counter misinformation is to provide clear and consistent communication from authorities, as well as to engage with peopleâ€™s emotions and values.
