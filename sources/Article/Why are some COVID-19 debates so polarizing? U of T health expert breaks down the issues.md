	- But also COVID forces the economy to function partially, there are negative health effects when there are unemployed people

### The contentiousness of the droplet vs. airborne transmission debate

- Scientists have debated this for the flu pre-covid, but now the entire world is watching

- It's irresponsible to be polarized about this because transmission could happen both ways and there's no way to fully tell
