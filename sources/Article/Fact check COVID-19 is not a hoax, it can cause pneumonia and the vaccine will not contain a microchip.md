### Claim one: Covid-19 is a scam

More than 63 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 1 million deaths have been reported by the WHO as of Dec 2, 2020

### Claim two: pneumonia not linked to COVID-19

The NHS website defines pneumonia as “swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection. It can also be caused by a virus, such as coronavirus (COVID-19)”

John Hopkins University, based in the north-eastern U.S. state of Maryland, explains: “COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, can cause lung complications such as pneumonia.

“In pneumonia, the lungs become filled with fluid and inflamed, leading to breathing difficulties. For some people, breathing problems can become severe enough to require treatment at the hospital with oxygen or even a ventilator”

### Claim three: the coronavirus vaccine will include a microchip

There is no evidence to support this and vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infection diseases

### Claim four: Scientists have not isolated the novel coronavirus

This claim is false: The SARS-CoV2-2 virus has been identified and studied by scientists globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 ([here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/naming-the-coronavirus-disease-(covid-2019)-and-the-virus-that-causes-it) ). The virus was identified by Chinese authorities on Jan. 7, 2020 ([here](https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov#:~:text=A%20novel%20coronavirus%20was%20identified,cold%20to%20more%20severe%20diseases)). It has since been studied by numerous researchers globally, just some of which are referred to [here](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-evolution-explaine/explainer-what-do-studies-on-new-coronavirus-mutations-tell-us-idUKKBN22J1HQ) .
