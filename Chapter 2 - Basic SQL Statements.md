## Introduction

Querying the database enables you to verify existing database tables, the structure of the tables, and the data values that are stored in the database

This chapter focuses on retrieving data from a database by using SELECT statements

## DESCRIBE (DESC)

The DESC command is used most often to view the structure of database objects

It returns the following values:
- table name
- data types
- primary and foreign keys
- nullable columns
- etc.

## SELECT Statement Syntax

Most of the operations that organizations perform in SQL are the SELECT statements

These statements enable the user to retrieve data from tables given a set of parameters

The user can either view all of the values of a given table or specific records (**rows**) and fields (**columns**)

The SELECT statement is called a ***query*** because it asks the database a question about the values inside of the database

What gets displayed on the screen after the query are the **results** or the answer to the question

This is the specific syntax for the SELECT statement:

The words that are capitalized are the keywords that are used in conjuncture with the SELECT statement to give the query more customization 

Each section inside of the figure that begins with a keyword is called a **clause** (same thing as a sentence)

- The only clauses that are **required** for the SELECT statement is **SELECT** and **FROM** because our query requires a table to probe
- Square brackets are optional
- SQL statements can either be all in one line or split up into multiple. 
	- The best practice is to enter each clause on a separate line for bet readability
- An SQL statement must end in a semicolon

### Selecting All Data in a Table

In order for the SELECT statement to return all of the data in a specific table, an asterisk must be placed after the SELECT

```
SELECT *
FROM customers;
```

The asterisk tells Oracle to include all of the columns (fields) of the table

When you want to refer to a specific field in the table, you need to specify the entire name of the column, not the truncated version

In order to get the entire column name, you can use the DESC command

### Selecting One Column from a Table

Choosing specific columns in a SELECT statement is called **projection**

You can either select one column, or multiple fields inside of the table to be displayed

```
SELECT title
FROM books;
```

Field names, keywords, and table names are not case sensitive. This means that commands such as these are equally valid:

```
SELECT TITLE FROM BOOKS;

select title from books;

SELECT title FROM books;

SELECT TITLE
 FROM BOOKS;
```

Although it's good practice to capitalize the keywords to distinguish them from field names, it's not necessary for the program to be functional

### Selecting Multiple Columns from a Table

```
SELECT pubdate, title
FROM books;
```

## Operations in the Select Statement

### Using Column Aliases

Sometimes the field names in the output can be pretty vague, in order to change the description of the data in the output, you can temporarily add a **column alias**

If you're displaying a list of all the books that are stored in the database, you can make the heading of a field say "Title of Book" using a column alias, to do this you do:

```
SELECT title AS "Title of Book", category
FROM books;
```

The **optional keyword** of **AS** has been added to distinguish between the column name and the column alias

Some guidelines to keep in mind
> if the field alias has spaces or special symbols, or you don't want it to appear in all upper case, then it *must* be enclosed in quotation marks ("")

> By default, column headings are shown as capitalized, however using quotation marks overwrites that

If the alias doesn't have any special characters (such as spaces) and is only one word, you can omit the quotations and the AS keyword and just do this:

```
SELECT title, retail price (price is highlighted yellow here to show alias)
FROM books;
``` 

### Using Arithmetic Operations

Simple operations (\*, \/, +, -) can be used in the SELECT clause of the query

Oracle adheres to BEDMAS, moving left to right

To override the standard order of operations, you need to use brackets for the portion of the equation that should be calculated first

There is no support for exponents in the SELECT statement, you would need to write in manually (5^3 would be 5 * 5 * 5)

In order to find the profit generated by the sale of each book, you would find the difference between the amount the bookstore paid for the book (cost) and the selling price of the book (retail)

```
SELECT title, retail-cost profit
FROM books;
```

if we don't do this then the output of the column name would default to ``RETAIL-COST``

### NULL Values

If there's no value entered for a field in a record (row), then that value is considered NULL

This means that there's an **absence of data**

NULL values can lead to some undesirable effects such as when you want to do arithmetic
> if any value within the calculation is a NULL then the result would be a NULL which isn't always ideal (especially if you want to calculate the price with discounts but some of the discounts are NULL)

### Using DISTINCT and UNIQUE

Lets say that you wanted to figure out all of the states that you customers live in

One option is to use the SELECT statement on the state table, however that will print out states more than once if there are multiple customers in the same state

One way that you can minimize the repeated lines is using the ``DISTINCT`` keyword:

```
SELECT DISTINCT state
FROM customers;
```

You can also use DISTINCT in combination with another field

```
SELECT DISTINCT state, city
FROM customers
```

You can also use UNIQUE, it works in the same way as DISTINCT

### Using Concatenation

Sometimes you want the contents of each field to be display next to each other, without any blank space

Whenever you want to display contents from many fields inside of one column, you need to use **concatenation**

To concatenate, you use two vertical bars between each field:

```
SELECT firstname || lastname
FROM customers;
```

However this makes the first name and last name fields into one word, which makes it pretty unreadable, to fix this you would add a ***string literal***:

```
SELECT firstname || ' ' || lastname
FROM customers;
```

A string literal tells Oracle that it needs to process whatever is in the string **literally** and is denoted by *single quotes*

You can also use a column alias to make it clearer:

```
SEELECT firstname || ' ' || lastname "Customer Name"
FROM customers;
```

You can also use literals to include any characters to make the output a certain format:

```
SELECT customer# || ' : ' || lastname || ', ' || firstname "Customer"
FROM customers;
```
