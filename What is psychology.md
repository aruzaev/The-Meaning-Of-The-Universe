## The History of Psychology 

---

The study of the human mind was originally an aspect of [[philosophy]], but later on went into the subject that is now psychology once the [[scientific method]] was applied

From this, psychology was able to be looked ar through a few phases:

1. **Structuralism** - studies the conscious mind through introspection
2. **Functionalism** - examined the utility of thought processes through an evolutionary lens
3. **Gestalt Psychology** - looks at the human mind and behaviour as a whole instead of focusing on small details
4. **Behaviourism** - rejects any study of the mind and suggests that observable actions were the only valid forms of research
5. **Psychoanalysis** - emphasized unconscious motivations for behaviour (Freud)
6. **Humanistic psychology** - more optimistic outlook on human behaviour and focuses on topics like individual choice and reaching one's full potential
7. **Cognitive psychology** - looks at essential mental processes such as memory, reasoning, and language
