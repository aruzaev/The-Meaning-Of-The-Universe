# Benefits of PL/SQL

- Integration of procedural code with SQL
- modularized program development
- improved performance
- great integration with ORACLE tools
- portable
- has exception handling

## Benefit 1

When you issue an SQL command, the command tells the database server what to do

But it doesn't tell the server how to do it or how many times it should be done

PL/SQL adds control statements and conditional statements to SQL, which gives you more flexibility over managing the database

## Benefit 2

The basic unit in PL/SQL is a **block**, which is what all programs consist of

These blocks are also known as modules, which you can combine into a sequence, or nest them on other blocks 

think scratch

Good programs will use modular programming to break down the problem into small sections

**Advantages:**

- you can group logically related statements with blocks
- you can nest blocks inside of other blocks to make the program more powerful
- you can share these blocks with other people on your team
- allows you to break down complex problems into small, manageable blocks, which makes the program easier to maintain
