# [[The Cognitive Stages of Development]]

## Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development

Jean Piaget believed that cognitive development happens within four stages which differ by how people reason instead of the amount of knowledge that they have:
1. Sensorimotor Stage (Birth-2)
2. Preoperational Stage (2-7)
3. Concrete Operations Stage (7-11 or 12)
4. Formal Operations Stage (11 - 12 and above)

Each stage shows a different way of reasoning and seeing the world
The rate in which people pass through them is variable on maturation and individual experience

Cognitive development begins with basic **schemas** (cognitive structures that are used to identify and interpret the world around you)

When seeing something new, the learner will **assimilate** the new stimulus into their existing schemas

Parents need to correct wrong behavior, meaning that the behavior cannot be assimilated into their schemas and the use of **accommodation** will occur (existing schemas are modified or new ones are made to process the new information)

### Sensorimotor Stage

Infant gets an understanding of the world via their senses and motor activities
As the infant gets older, their reflexive actions become mental actions where they can do things for a specific goal

**Object permanence** is developed, which is the realization that objects out of sight still exist

### Preoperational Stage

Rapid development in language

Children are better at representing objects mentally or with words and images
Thinking is more abstract
They can imitate the behavior of someone who isn't in the room (representational thought)

Imaginary play is possible (broom as a horse)
Egocentrism - they believe everyone sees what they see and think as they think and feel

Beliefs that the trees, sun, and dolls are alive and have feelings and intentions
Children believe that natural things like the sun and the moon are made by people and are for people

They can't yet perform mental operations that follow logical rules and have no concept of mass or volume (conservation, think of tall and wide cup)

**Centration** - tendency to focus on only one dimension of an object and neglect other dimensions (taller cup means more)

Lack of **Reversibility** - realization that after an object is changed, it can be returned to its original state

### Concrete Operations Stage

Realization that other people have thoughts and perceptions of their own

Can focus on more than one dimension of a stimulus at the same time
Understanding reversibility, which is important for critical thinking

They can't apply these things to hypothetical, verbal, or abstract problems yet

### Formal Operations Stage

Can apply reversibility and conservation to hypothetical, verbal, or abstract problems

Not everyone gets full formal operational thinking (even adults, because it requires training)

## Cognitive Gains in Adolescence

Improvements in metacognitive and metamemory skills

Metacognition is the ability to think about cognitive processes
Metamemory is the control of memory processes

You are more equipped to handle the intellectual demands of college than when you were in highschool

This is because you can manage the knowledge that you have and attain more effectively
