# [[Counterpoint - Globalization Benefits Powerful Businesses at the Expense of Poor Nations]]
---

**Thesis** - Globalization was created by international corporations and wealthy nations out of their own selfish economic interests. Because of this:

- there is a lack of equality between nations and the classes of people living in the nations
- culture and democracy is threatened
- serious environmental damage is taking place

It is not a neutral or inevitable process

## The Globalization Story

Most people seem to think globalization is an inevitable process due to advancements in transportation and communication

These advancements stem from **industrialization**, which has historically been influenced by economic powers (rich people and countries)

These changes in industrialization don't affect everyone the same way:
**Increases in trade capacity serve to help transnational corporations and leaders of powerful nations at the expense of others**

It can be called, ***economic globalization*** instead because of the main monetary interest that helps this process along

Globalization **isn't inevitable** because there are mass groups of protesters against it, people from different classes

The movement says that economic globalization isn't the only way to go, **and that there are better alternatives**

---
## Unequal Players

There is inequality on the state and international level

People will access to international networks (workers with globally applicable skills and transnational networks) **are the only ones that reap the benefits of globalization**

Transnational corporations can pick and choose who their workers are and where they come from

Workers in manual labor industries are losing their jobs in Western countries because of a preference of **outsourcing** to countries with cheap labor

**Income gap between different kinds of workers**

The gap impacts countries too (Nations with more resources take advantage of new markets and leave behind developing nations)

---
## Movers and Shakers

Manual labor workers have to move to find new jobs in growing areas, which is financially, culturally, and emotionally traumatic

Workers that can't move have to live in **urban slums**, which have increased crime and overpopulation

In the domestic labor market in Canada, labor jobs are more globally competitive, meaning that **organized labor/unions are uneconomical**

This causes health/dental plans, pensions, and vacations to no longer be negotiable

If you complain, your job will be given to someone else who will demand less

**Privatization** demands for labor jobs to be contracted out to the cheapest worker

People work for lower wages instead of high salaries

Public servants lose their jobs to private firms

Laborers are exploited in poor countries with little wages and no benefits

---
## To the End of the Earth

Globalization harms the environment because there is increased **production**, **transportation**, and **consumption**

Since globalization is rooted in making money, things that don't have a price, such as **water and air, are unaccounted for**

This causes the ozone layer to be depleted, sea levels to rise, and fresh water supplies to crumble all for the sake of **monetary gain**

---
## Poisoned Diversity and the Death of Democracy

Globalization needs a free market economy and a flexible labor force to function

These features are developed by powerful people and everyone else must follow them to participate in globalization

If they can't, they get burned and their economies will be affected negatively

In order to participate, **you must adopt a liberal capitalist economic structure**
aka
***Americanization***

This results in decreasing cultural diversity at the expense of increased trade and consumption

This also **limits a government's sovereignty** (self-governance), if a nation wants to be wealthy, they must adjust their laws to make them more agreeable with international markets

This becomes very **costly** to do, meaning health insurance and welfare is cut, and taxes get raised

**Domestic markets are simply abandoned***

Democracy gets weakened because the state is abandoned in lieu of homogenization

Decisions about labor are no longer decided by the state but by corporations
