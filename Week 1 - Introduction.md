## Definitions:

#### Web Application

A set of web pages that are created when a user requests them (i.e. putting a url in the top bar --> contacting the server the web app is hosted on --> returns web page), OR any application that can be run in a web browser

The client and the servers are both connected through the internet

#### Web API (Application Programming Interface)

Pre-written software/code that allows information to be sent from one place to another over the internet (such as a website to a user, Twitter feed to your own RSS feed)

We can build Web APIs using many technologies like Java and .NET

End points that exist to perform a specific task whenever the user wants to

Usually needs authentication (usually an API key) to ensure that the user is correct and has permissions to request data or perform a task with the API

#### Web Service

A service on the web that uses an API to provide data using a messaging system such as XML and JSON

Designed to be used by other machines and applications

i.e. The random facebook like buttons that exist in various other websites or login through facebook or google account (Facebook and Google exposed these functionalities to the website)

**The difference between a web app and a web service** is that a web app is designed to be interacted by humans whereas a web service is designed to be interacted with by other code and machines ???

#### Full Stack Development

The process of creating the front-end elements of a websites (the things that the user interacts with such as the HTML, CSS, and visual JS libraries) as well as building a server and a database (back-end)

MEAN/MERN stack
