---

The relational database is one of the most widely used databases today. You are most likely using a relational database whenever you purchase something online or at a store, check out books at a library, or open up a bank account with an agent.

## Types of Databases

**A database is** an *organized collection of data used for modelling* and isn't dependent on any software 

You can use pencil and paper (stores used to have physical [ledgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger) ) or a simple program, if it's organized data, it is a database

There are *two types of databases*:
1. Operational databases
2. Analytical databases

### Operational Databases

Primarily used in online transaction processing ([OLTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing)) that requires collection, modification, and maintenance of countless amounts of data on a daily basis

(online banking, shopping, order entry, text messages)

The data stored is *dynamic* - goes through countless changes and has up-to-date minute by minute information

### Analytical Databases

Primarily used in online analytical processing ([OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing)) which stores a lot of historical and time dependent data

It is used for tracking trends, viewing statistical data over a long period of time, and making important business projections based on decades of previous data

The data stored is *static* - never gets modified and is used as a reliable point of reference

(chemical labs, marketing analysis firms, geological companies)

## Early Database Models

Before the invention of the relational database model, there were two types of data models that were used to maintain and manipulate data:

1. The Hierarchical database model
2. The Network database model

### The Hierarchical Database Model

Data is structured in a hierarchy and is pictured as an inverted tree

A single table in the database is the root of the tree with other tables branching off of it 

![[01-01.jpg]]

A parent table (such as AGENTS) can have one or more child tables but a single child table can only be associated with one parent table

The tables are usually linked by pointers and require a good understanding of the database structure 

Similar to the file management system ? (./home/Documents/code/etc...)

**Advantages**:
- User can retrieve data quickly because there are explicit links (pointers) between the tables
- Ensures proper [referential integrity](https://intelligent-ds.com/blog/what-is-referential-integrity) because it is built in and automatically enforced
	- a record in a child table must be linked to an existing record in the parent table
	- a record deleted in a parent table will delete referenced of that record in the children

**Disadvantages**:
- The user can't store a record in a child table that is unrelated to a record in a parent table
	- A user can't add a record in ENTERTAINERS unless also assigning the new entertainer to an AGENT
	- This rule can be circumvented by assigning a dummy entity in the parent table to the new entity in the child table but it isn't optimal
- No support for complex relationships (like a relationship between the entertainers and clients)
	- This creates a need for redundant data in the SCHEDULE and ENGAGEMENT tables
		- The SCHEDULE table will have info about the client name, address, and phone number which is redundant because that data is already in the CLIENTS table
		- The ENGAGEMENT table will have data about the entertainer name, phone number, and type which is redundant because the data is already in the ENTERTAINERS table
	- This redundancy creates inconsistencies when inserting data into the tables

Mainly used in the 1970s for tape storage systems in mainframes
### The Network Database Model

Was created to address some of the problems of the hierarchical database model

The model consisted of **nodes** and **set structures**

A **node** is a collection of records and a **set structure** is a representation of the relationships between the nodes 

![[01-03.jpg]]

![[01-04.jpg]]

Nodes have an owner and member role with a set structure and an action to connect the two

A record in the owner node can be related to one or more records in the member node but a record in the member node can only be related to one record in the owner node 

A record in the member node cannot exist without also being related to an existing record in the owner node

The user can simply start at any node and work their way down or up instead of starting at the route

**Advantages**:
- Fast data access
- Allows users to create databases that are more complex with more intricate relationships

**Disadvantages**:
- The user also has to be very familiar with the structure of the database to work through the sets
- It's not easy to change the data and relationships without affecting the programs that interact with it and use the structure to navigate through the data
	- If you change a set, you also need to modify all the references in the program to that set

## The Relational Database Model

It was invented in 1969 and uses specific branches of math (set theory and first-order predicate logic) to handle large amounts of data

Indeed, the name of the model itself is derived from the term _relation,_ which is part of set theory. (A widely held misconception is that the relational model derives its name from the fact that tables within a relational database can be related to one another.)

The relational database stores data in relations, or tables

Each record in a table is identified by a field that has **unique value**, which makes the way that the records are physically ordered completely irrelevant 

It removes the necessity of needing to know the layout of the structures when retrieving data

![[01-05.jpg]]

A relationship between two or more tables is created by matching values of a shared field

You can access data that are directly related or indirectly related (such as getting a list of clients and which performers performed for them)
