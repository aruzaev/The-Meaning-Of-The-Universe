Resume writing - content

Recruiters don't give feedback when rejecting you because some people may get angry and no accept the feedback

If you get rejected:
do allow yourself to feel your emotions 

When you apply for jobs, go into it with the mentality that you will get rejected

1. you are going to get rejected, when you are rejected you are going to get hurt (have a cushion)
	1. use systems, let your family and friends know what's going on and your job searching journey, that can keep you healthy
		1. this can also be people that are going through the same journey
			1. have 1 - 10 people that are also looking for jobs
			2. dont only network with recruiters, but network with other job seekers
			3. they are not your competition, they can be your comiserators that can work with you (if your friend fails an interview, they can tell you what went down etc and vice versa)
			4. dont suffer in silence, vent to other people
2. Get a job coach from government employment agencies
	1. they can help you with finding a job
3. Send a reply to the rejection email, ask them for any suggestions or feedback to improve (I'm very interested in improving my interview skills, please provide me with at least one piece of feedback)
