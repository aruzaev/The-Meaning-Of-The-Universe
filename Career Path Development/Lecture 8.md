Preparing for interview questions is really important 

It requires a lot of clarity such as who you are, what you did in the past, and your skills

It's not a good idea to think about questions if you haven't heard the question before, its important to have the answers ready

Ask people in your life (professors, teachers, coworkers, friends, etc) what kind of interview questions they had

Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Provide professional goals instead of private goals

Tell me about yourself? The most critical question there is
Do not recite your whole resume unless they ask you to walk through it
Always ask "is that all you wanted to know?", always clarify
No more than two minutes per answering questions

Talk about relevant educational background
Create a concise one-liner for the response
Also talk about some relevant past experience with work
