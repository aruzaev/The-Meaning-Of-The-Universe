Resume writing

Anatomy of the resume (the structure of the resume, skeleton)
ATS (application tracking system)

Your resume is your passport to get you into the interview system

On paper you should make sure that you are qualified which would make it easier for the recruiter to see if you're qualified

Personal projects can be important if they are relevant to the job that you're applying to

if portfolio isn't required, it is nice to have projects on your resume if they pertain to the job at hand

A lot of people can get hired but just because their resume is bad or doesnt reflect who they are and their qualifiations and they lose out on the job interview 

Recruiters have a limited amount of time and energy and they will select the resumes that they deem are the most qualifies

Your resume has to be prepared with utmost care and detail

The correct format is that there shouldnt be any format
Your format should be very simple (no emoji, tables, graphics), you should only be using the keyboard and it should look very simple

## ATS and AI

There is no AI that filters out resume based on keywords, there is an ATS (application tracking system) which is a database software that has a list of all applications that are being sent to a company

ATS is expensive, not every company has the budget to have an ATS, some even use an excel sheet

The ones that do have ATS it is so basic that there is no space or budget for an AI

Even in a very developed ATS the recruiter needs to look through all of the resumes, when you are rejected, the recruiter has to give an internal reason and the recruiting manager has to check that

It's a very manual process, there are scripts with buttons (rejection, call for an interview, in person interview) that sends out the same email or text to the candidates

## Format

There shouldn't be any specific format

### "Formatted" Resumes

There shouldnt be any pictures, color, tabs, emojis, parts, or lining

The "resume online builders" are bad and badly formatted

Why are formatted resumes bad? **Because they don't pass through the ATS**

ATSs will not be able to extract the data (your name, address, etc)

Those formatted resumes become pictures instead of text, meaning that it would be impossible to parse without the recruiter doing it manually

If one resume is formatted and the other one isn't, the simpler one is chosen because recruiters don't have time to manually parse everything

There are two shoes (ones that look nice but aren't very comfortable, but comfortable shoes but are ugly)

You would get the comfortable shoes

### Anatomy of a Resume

First Name Last Name - follow Canadian standard, don't use your middle name
Try to make the name as easy as possible, your name is VERY important

Don't write your full address, only City, Province, and Zip code

Email address and linkedin (use bitly if the links are too long)

Top skills - add numbers, add achievements, add your best accomplishments

Work experience (say this instead of professional experience) - Name of Company, Location and under that say job title

Add month/year to present, add the month to be more precise

Don't write a paragraph, just list out achievements and accomplishments
Write two lines about the company

It doesn't matter if its one or two pages, there is no specific rule about it

Meaningful additions only, don't stretch out the resume just for the reason of making it longer

If you actually have things to say, say them

Say if it was a contract, internship, volunteer (if the duration was shorter the recruiter wouldn't question it because if a internship lasted four months then they wont think you got fired/etc)

OPTIONAL but you can also write if it was hybrid/remote/in person

List out all the skills or technologies that you used at a company, don't worry about being too repetitive,  repeat the technologies where they were actually used

Education - you can put that under your top skills if you recently graduated and have no experience

Write the full name of the degree and the full/official name of the institution, write the location (Toronto, Ontario), write the duration too

You can separate the skills (Software skills, personal skills)

- first name last name
- location (City, Province, Postal Code)
- email
- cell number
- Profile summary of overview of your profile
- education in the beginning if new grad
- certification (full name, month and year of receiving)
- full name of your course, full name of college, time duration (MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY)
- Work history
	- Name of your company, location (City, province or if it was in another country - put  country)
	- title or designation
	- duration (from - to, month and year)
	- contract or permanent of part time or internship
	- optional: remote hybrid or onsite
	- if you dont have much experience, you can use volunteer work if its relavant to the job
- 2 lines about the company
- no paraagraph (roles and responsibilites)
- list achievements, objectives, learning, KPIs, targets achieved
- competition or participation in any professonal or athletic competition
	- hackathon, captone
- paper publication
- dont make it task oriented
- add numbers and percentages
- after a space, create a skills tab: list all the tools and technologies you have used under that work experiences
- add volunteer experience (if its relavant to your work or if you have no work experience then add it if if it adds value to your resume)
- add association (if you're an accountant CPA, scrum master) use meetup.com
	- toastmasters, anything else that can develop your personality
- Languages (other languages than English - level of fluency) kind of useful to be able to talk to certain clients
- Interests (they may ask you about them, make sure its related to the job/professional - it makes you look like you have a personality)
- Achievements or Awards or Recognition

if you can copy paste your resume into a blank word document and it doesnt change or become nonlegible, then it is ATS friendly

You can have two versions of resumes, a short one and a long one (submit with short one and during the interview ask if they want a long one)

## Cover letters

Mention your preference (if you need hybrid or remote work)
Its not a summary of your resume, it is an addition to your resume
everything that can't be included in the resume will get included 
Three points that you cannot add in your resume

three files:
1. resume pdf
