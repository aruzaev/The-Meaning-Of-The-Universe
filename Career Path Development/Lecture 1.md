proper judgement for career goals so you dont feel like a failure

Setting goals is important to figure out what you want to do

Different kinds of goals (financial, getting a job (software engineer or web developer), mental health)

Goals have to be very specific and have a specific timeline
they need to be measurable

measurable = manageable

"I want to get an internship in 4 months with x and y parameters"

Don't make too ambitious goals and make goals that you can achieve in a certain amount of time

Goals also need to be relevant

Take into account how much time things need to take (courses, keeping mental sanity, preparation)

Timeline: what issue exists today and how to solve it
sometimes timelines are given to you (critically)
learn from your own experiences and how much time things took you to learn (non critical)
Key is sense of urgency 
If you only have 4 months for visa and need an internship by then, if you dont have that then you can set a longer timeline

if you set a goal or timeline, you can see if you've exceeded it (measuring)

Get a mentor (look for people on linkedin and ask them how people have gotten to where they are and how you could get to where they are)

Do some rese
