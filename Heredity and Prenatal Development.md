# [[Heredity and Prenatal Development]]
[[Developmental Psychology]]

## The Mechanism of Heredity: Genes and Chromosomes

Genes are the biological blueprints of all hereditary traits that are found in structures called chromosomes which are located in the nuclei of our body cells

Normally, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes within the body cells

Before birth, the sperm adds 23 chromies to the other 23 in the egg, making a **zygote** which is the genetic material needed to make a human being

22 of the 23 pairs of chromies has genes for certain physical and mental traits

The one in the 23rd pair is called the *sex chromosome* which determines the person's sex and the traits associated with the sex (male pattern baldness, hemophilia, r-g color blindness)

### Dominant and Recessive Genes: Dominants Call the Shots

**Dominant genes** are the ones that cause a dominant trait to appear in the person (brown > blond hair, brown eyes > blue eyes)

**Recessive genes** are only expressed if they are paired with another recessive gene and not a dominant gene

**Polygenic genes** don't involve dominant and recessive genes and are when multiple genes work together to produce a trait, height is an example of this

They are also multifactorial, meaning that they are dependent on both genes and environment 

Height is influences by several genes but also environmental factors such as nutrition

## The Stages of Prenatal Development: Unfolding According to Plan

The three stages are as follows:
1. Prenatal
2. Embryonic
3. Fetus 
### Prenatal

When the zygote is formed, within two weeks it travels to the uterine wall and then engages in cell division in two parts:
1. for the formation of the fetus
2. for the support structures to surround the fetus

After this stage, the zygote is only small as a period.

### Embryonic

Organs and other major systems begin to develop from head to toe and then from trunk to extremities

This occurs between week 3 and 8 and has enough rudimentary features to be a human embryo

### Fetus

Rapid growth and further development of organs and systems in the body

## Negative Influences on Prenatal Development: Sabotaging Nature's Plan

**Teratogens** are things in the prenatal environment that can cause birth defects

There are different kinds of teratogens:
- Maternal illnesses (diabetes can induce intellectual deficits or acceleration of fetal growth, Viral diseases can make infants have physical and behavioral abnormalities)
- Drugs
- environmental hazards
- prenatal malnutrition

Even though physical defects are possible from teratogens, they mostly cause intellectual and social impairment

### Newborns at High Risk

- Low birth weight babies (<2.5 kg)
- Preterm babies (born at or before the 37th week)

These issues can induce complications such as intellectual defects, blindness, hearing loss, or death
