# [[The Banality of Heroism]] - Philip Zimbardo
---

The Stanford Prison experiment simulated real prison (young men who volunteered were arrested at their homes and booked like in a real prison)

Each group BECAME the guards or prisoners because the situation legitimately called for it

The experimenters even got caught up in the prison drama, which made them lose objectivity

Under certain circumstances and social pressures, ordinary people would do things they would deem "unthinkable"

Stanley Milgram experiment - the majority of the teachers gave deadly shocks because they were pressured by the environment and researchers

**The banality of evil is that people seem to think that doing bad things are evil people, but the reality is that anyone could do bad things if compelled enough**

**Bystander effect** - Bystanders that don't say no to bad things happening in front of them are also wrong because they give *implicit approval to continue* (Abu Ghraib, Nazi Germany) **BECAUSE THEY THINK SOMEONE ELSE WILL SAY NO**

The bystander allows for these things to happen *The situation dictated their inaction, and their inaction facilitated evil*

**Banality of evil** - a suggestion that we are all potential heroes waiting for our chance to do good, this is within the range of possibilities for every person

Even people that did a life of bad (Jabbar Gibson and renegade bus in Hurr. Katrina)

**Heroic Elect** - A myth that reinforces two basic human tendencies

1. People who do something special or heroic are superhuman and "beyond" everyone else
2. Trap of the bystander

The banality of heroism suggests that everyone can do good and has that desire to preform a heroic act and it **debunks heroic effect** by giving that privilege of heroism to everybody

## What is heroism?

Heroism isn't selflessness, it is the potential for deep personal sacrifice for the sake of another human

It's the individual's commitment to a noble purpose and the will to overcome the consequences of that purpose

**Social heroism** is in service to a noble idea that doesn't necessarily cause physical peril (MLK with equal rights)

There are at least four independent dimensions of heroism:

1. Some type of quest
2. Some form of actual or anticipated sacrifice or risk
3. Passive or active
4. Can be sudden, a one time act, or something that happens over a long period of time

### Some type of quest

May range from the preservation of a life (Frank De Martini rushing into the WTC on 9/11 to save people)

or the preservation of an ideal (MLK for black equal rights)

### Sacrifice or risk

Can either be physical risk (firefighters against nature)

or an immense social sacrifice (Tom Cahill risked his credibility to tell people that the air was safe to breathe on ground zero of the 9/11 attacks)

### Passive or active

Oftentimes we think of heroes as doing something that's *active* or clearly observable (a firefighter entering a burning building) but heroism can also be **passive** through a passive resistance on unwillingness to be moved

"I regret that I have but one life to give for my country"

### Sudden, one time act, or persisting over a long time

Could be an average guy pulling out an unconscious driver before a train hits the car

or it could be a well thought-out plan over multiple days, months, or a lifetime

Japanese consul signed many visas for Jews that were trying to escape Nazi Germany

## Who makes a hero?

Life and death situations typically bring out heroism within people

Other situations like being a witness to discrimination and atrocities bring out the worst in people but they can also bring out the best

People that are typically heroes have enough internal strength and self-assurance to be guided by their own internal compass in uncertain situations

Sugihara already was attempting to defy Japanese society

Sometimes a problem may leave us with a "moral tickle" which cannot be ignored - that indicates that something is wrong

**An important factor to if a heroic act is performed is if there is heroic imagination in the past**

**Heroic Imagination** - an individual that has previously considered situations that required heroic action is more likely (and ready) to act heroically when the opportunity arises

Strengthening HI helps to make the individual create ethical tests to uncertain situations

## How to nurture the heroic imagination

Role models like inventors, athletes, actors, politicians, and scientists aren't heroes even though they may have traits that we would like to see in our children

They haven't demonstrated courage and fortitude 

If we diminish the term "heroism" by throwing it around at anyone that does good, we **dilute** the important contributions of real heroes like Abraham Lincoln and a random hero

People also stop using hero imagination, thus invalidating words such as bravery, fortitude, gallantry, and valor

We no longer think about the deeper meaning and representation of these actions

To nurture **heroic imagination** we must do the following steps:

1. Be mindful about situations that would require us to be vigilant heroes and to develop an awareness of things that don't fit or aren't right by **asking questions and gathering information**
2. Not to fear conflict and to develop hardiness to stand firm on our principles. **Don't think of it as conflict but rather attempts to challenge other people's beliefs to see if they really believe that**
3. We should be aware of the future, remember the past, and not just the present. Part of our focus should be on the alternative scenarios that may happen based on different actions and failures to act in the present. We should also remember the values that were taught to us in the past
4. **Resist the urge to justify your past and present inaction**
5. Look past predicting any negative consequence that's associated with what is right in  your opinion, even if that means burning your bridges

In classic tales, there is always a mystical figure that tries to seduce the hero from his path, in real life these seductors could be an unethical friend, family member, or coworker. 

By ignoring the temptations of those people, we serve to establish little habits of heroism

It is important to **maintain and remember a set of teachings** that serves as a litmus test to determine right from wrong and to always fall back on them
