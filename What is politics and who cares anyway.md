# [[What is politics and who cares anyway]]
---

Politics is everywhere (wages we earn, tuition, wars we fight, climate change, etc)

Politics is derived from the Greek term *polis* which means city state or political community, **the dynamics of power in human society**

**Narrow definitions** of politics involve the *intentional* action to achieve certain goals collectively

**Broad definitions** of politics rejects separating public and private life and involves the ***complex systems of power and distribution*** in all things, like buying a cup of coffee (\*it isn't intentional collective power for one goal)

Participation in these complex systems is political, meaning that the "everyday" is political

Buying a cup of coffee, only a small percent of that is given to the farmers that grew those beans 

## Ideology: one reality, many lenses
---

Our ***political ideology*** is our basic beliefs about how we think the world should work

Ideologies help us establish a framework for how to act and to understand our place in society and help us explain social issues such as poverty

How is it that Canada, the 24th wealthiest country in the world, has so many people living under the poverty line?

How we respond to these questions will tell us what political side we follow (if the poor people just don't have motivation, you are on the right wing. If the social framework is messed up which causes poverty, you are on the left wing)


### Understanding the Ideological Spectrum

There are three historically dominant political ideologies:

1. Liberalism
2. Conservatism
3. Socialism

Ideologies are on a spectrum called ***the principle of egalitarianism***

The further to the right that we move, the greater the tolerance for the socioeconomic hierarchy:

The further to the left that we move, the more we are committed to socioeconomic equality 

#### Liberalism

Is in the center of the spectrum and is most concerned about protecting ***individual freedom and liberty*** 

According to this perspective, all people should live as they want with the exception of not unjustly impeding on the liberties of other people

The capitalist *free market* and the ownership of individual private property as well as protection of one's private religious and moral life is a big component of liberalism

Liberalism enforces a legal framework called the ***equality of right***
	people have fundamental rights regardless of individual characteristics like race, class and gender

which the government has to protect

e.x Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (every individual is equal under and before the law)

More left leaning views of liberalism point to the government as being responsible for ensuring that all individuals have *equal opportunities for their own development and well being* (healthcare and education)

To ensure that the government policies reflect what people want, this ideology promotes *representative democracy* which is when citizens fairly decide who will be their representative in the government who will represent their interest

All citizens have legal right to run for office and all votes are equal

#### Conservatism

is on the right side of the ideological spectrum, shares the same free-market economy and representative democracy notion as liberalism

but it values order and security over individual liberty and legal equality

e.x racial profiling at the airport (a no go for liberals but reasonable for conservatives for the sake of national security)

***Conserving*** traditions and institutions (private property, religion, and family)

Change should be made with extreme caution (and only when the social benefits of change outweigh the costs of sticking to tradition) or **not at all**

e.x. Opposition of same sex marriage (the family is the cornerstone of stability from religious teachings a long-held cultural values and same sex marriage is a risky challenge that could dismantle that)

Government interference in the economy is strongly frowned upon

Capitalism is best because it allows people to have economic incentive to work hard

Charities are private rather than relying on taxpayer money and government planning

**Socioeconomic hierarchy** is the natural feature of human society and that there will always be people who are at the bottom and people who are at the top (natural inequality)

#### Socialism

is on the left side of the ideological spectrum, **rejects** the conservative view of inequality in society

Views that extreme wealth and extreme poverty aren't natural or inevitable, but it happens because of our global capitalist economy

"We cannot all be Bill Gates, because then who would work for Microsoft?"

There is a handful of people that own land and financial capital and the rest of us **work under them in exchange for a wage**

One's economic status isn't a reflection of their skill or talent, but rather ownership, privilege, and opportunity

It argues that the capitalist free market puts money in the hands of a select few at the expense of the world's majority

One's economic status is closely connected to one's political status (the more money I have the more opportunities I have and the more people that I can influence)

The **liberal goal** of legal equality is unachievable under capitalism (all Canadians can run for office but only people with money and connections can get anywhere)

Socialism ***advocates*** to replace global capitalism with equal redistribution among all members of society 

and to create an ***equality of condition*** which seeks to have all members of society have the same standard of living and access to opportunities (healthcare, education, employment)

### Deeper Ideologies

The vertical axis is either authoritarianism (top) or libertarianism (bottom)

#### Authoritarianism 

supports the concentration of power in the hands of the government

the most extreme form of this includes:
- a highly militarized state
- elimination of free elections
- severe restrictions on individual rights and freedoms

##### Fascism

Extremely nationalistic and is rooted in the extreme right of authoritarianism (Nazi Germany, Mussolini's Italy, Pinochet's Chile)

It's on the right because it commits to private property and the capitalist economic system

##### Communism

removes free market and creates a government-run economy and is rooted in the extreme left of authoritarianism (Soviet Union, China, Castro's Cuba)

Both fascism and communism support powerful and repressive systems of government

---
#### Libertarianism

supports free will, personal autonomy, and political freedom

##### Anarchism

without rule or systems in place - which most libs disagree with

##### Right-wing libertarianism

deep distrust of the government and intense commitment to individual liberty

all government rules are a violation of individual rights and freedoms (right to bear arms)

##### Left-wing libertarianism

deep commitment to collective well-being

dismantling capitalism and the government and redistributing the wealth to small local communities
