# [[Developmental Psychology]]

This is the study of how we grow, develop, and change throughout our lives

It is a large field of study with many areas such as:
- in a particular age group
- physical development
- language
- social
- cognitive
- moral

## Controversial Issues in Developmental Psychology

1. **The Nature-nurture controversy** is the debate on how much heredity or the environment that we grow up in influences our development. One side says that our abilities are solely influenced by our genetics. Another side says that the circumstances where we were raised dictate our future
2. **Is development continuous or does it happen in stages?** Children change *quantitatively* via their height, the characteristic of height is the same for all children, older ones just have more of it. Logical thinking is *qualitative* in nature, meaning that it cannot be measured. A 10 year old thinks different logically than a 3 year old (not just more logic, but a different way of thinking)
3. **Are traits**, such as intelligence, aggression, and temperament, **stable over time or do they change over time**

## Approaches to Studying Developmental Change

There are two ways that psychologists use to observe changes throughout ages:
1. Longitudinal study
2. Cross-sectional study

### Longitudinal Study

The use of the same of people over a period of years or their entire lifespan

Benefits: allows for stability and reduces variables (because the people are the same, you can more accurately notice any changes over time)
Downsides: Time-consuming, expensive, and some participants lack will to continue going which can lead to biased results

### Cross-sectional Study

The comparison of multiple different age groups at one point in time with respect to various characteristics

This determines any age related differences

It cannot determine is the temperament of individuals is stable over time
But it CAN determine the differences in how the era in which you grew up in has influences your development

These are called *cohort differences*
