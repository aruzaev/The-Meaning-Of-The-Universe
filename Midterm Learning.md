## Systems
---

**Information systems analysis and design** is a process that organizations use to develop and maintain computer-based systems.

Understanding the business and how it functions is the most important part of systems analysis and design

Current approaches of systems analysis and design rely on **rapid and constant delivery** (agile development) done by small teams of developers


Methodologies are comprehensive, multi-step approaches to systems design that will help ensure efficiency and quality in delivering the final product

Techniques are specific processes that help system analysts ensure that their work is thought out and makes sense to other people. There are a lot of tasks involved, such as **information gathering (future topic)**, planning and managing the activities of the project, diagramming the logic of the system, and designing the system's interface and outputs

Tools are computer programs that make it easy to follow a company's methodology
