Orientalism is the study of "Orientals" or people that came from exotic Asian countries when Europeans first discovered them

The Europeans separated the world with the east and west, the west being the correct and civilized half while the east being uncivilized and inferior

Europeans viewed themselves as the superior race, which made them justify colonizing the east (to make the uncivilized civilized)

They started **generalizing** the attributes that they saw in Orientals, creating stereotypes which are still felt today (Arabs are defined as uncivilized and Islam is terrorism)

#### **The Orient has helped define the West as its contrasting image and idea (they are NOT like us, we are better)**

Everything that the Orient is, is not what we are
