## The emergence of the global economic order

[[Bretton Woods Agreement]] was an agreement set in place in 1944 by the major economic powers to reverse the perfectionist policies of the interwar (1918-39) period

This was considered to be the golden age of capitalism because wages were high and the social services were numerous, but America fell into economic turmoil after Nixon abandoned the agreement in the 70s

In the 80s, the term [[neoliberalism]] was popularized with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan came together against [[keynesianism]]
