# [[Introduction to System Analysis and Design]]

## **What is System Analysis**

This is the process of collecting and interpreting the facts, making note of the problems, and decomposing a certain system into its individual components

Analyzing a system is a problem solving technique that is conducted in order to study a system, its parts, and its objectives

It improves the system and ensures that all the components of a system work efficiently to accomplish their task

Through analyzing the system we can determine **what a system should do and how its doing it**

## System Design

The process of designing a new system for a business or a purpose OR replacing an old/legacy system for a more efficient one based on a list of certain requirements

This is typically done by defining the components of a system that satisfy the specific requirements

Before designing a new system it's important to understand the old system to determine how computers can be best used to operate efficiently

System design focuses on **how to accomplish the objective of the system**

## System Analysis and Design

SAD mainly focuses on:
- systems
- processes
- technology

This process is guide for developing high quality information systems

## What are systems?

A **system** can be:
- inventory management system
- payroll system
- library management system
- banking system

It is just a set of components or a network of components working together for a certain purpose

A **mission critical system** is something that is vital for the company's day-to-day operations

e.x. an order processing system for a shop

## Elements of Systems

- processor(s)
- outputs and inputs
- control
- feedback
- boundaries
- interface
