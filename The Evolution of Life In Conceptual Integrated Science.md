## Darwin and *The Origin of Species*
---

Fossils suggested that life on Earth changed, old species died and new species emerged

Fossils had an eerie resemblance to modern species, suggesting that they could be *ancestors* of modern species

**Jean-Baptise Lamarck** believed that species changed over time to better adapt to their environments
> organisms acquired new features and passed them along to their kids (giraffes had longer and longer necks because their parents had long necks, iteration of generations)

This was called the ***inheritance of acquired characteristics***

This, however, was only partly true - animals **cannot pass along** those new characteristics because they were **not genetic**

**Charles Darwin** proposed that evolution (inherited changed in populations of organisms over time) created how all living things are the way that they are now

> the giraffes grew their necks because the population that had longer necks (and therefore more access to food) had more offspring

He saw 13 different species of Galapagos finches with distinct sizes and beak shapes based on their various diets

#### Gradual Iteration over long periods of time 

One of his copartners, Charles Lyell believed that the **earth is shaped** not by a singular colossal natural event, but of many small and gradual iterations (a deep canyon from thousands of years of a river eroding the ground)
> Darwin believed this too can be applied to animals

#### The birth of Natural Selection

Another partner, Thomas Malthus noticed how populations of people grow faster than supplies of food, which leads to famine and people dying
> Darwin applied this idea, because there are limited amounts of resources, living things have to fight for existence
> Organisms with more advantageous features had more offspring and the population changed because of that

This was called **natural selection** and it's a major force in evolution

## How Natural Selection Works
---

Australia had a major rabbit problem, the government decided to build a really long fence to control them but they were able to jump on top of each other to climb the fence

The government then released a deadly rabbit virus that killed them, but eventually fewer rabbits were dying because of **natural selection**

The small number of rabbits that were resistant to the virus survived the disease and reproduced, passing this resistance to their offspring

While the non-resistant rabbits were **dying out**, the resistant population was thriving and eventually all of Australia's rabbit population was resistant

**Natural Selection works when an organism with a certain advantageous trait leaves more offspring than organisms that don't have that trait, eventually changing the population**

#### The Process of Natural Selection

1.  *Variation* - all species have variation in their traits (humans have varying height, skin color, blood type, foot size, hair color)
2. *Heritability* - many of these traits are at least partly because of genes, which can be passed down to offspring or **inheritable**
3. *Natural Selection* - some heritable traits are advantageous and the organisms that possess these traits leave more offspring than the ones without these traits
	1. The **fitness** of an organism describes the number of offspring it leaves over its lifetime than other members of that population (greater # of babies = greater fitness)
4. *Adaptation* - the offspring with more advantageous traits becomes more common and the population becomes better adapted to the environment

## Adaptation
---

Adaptations are traits that make organisms better suited to survive and reproduce in an environment

Some adaptations allow the organism to **survive** which means to:
- **obtain food** and other resources needed to live
- not becoming food for someone else (these adaptations can be camouflage, toxicity, ability to run or hide)

Other adaptations allow the organism to **find mates** (*sexual selection*):
- beautiful feathers on male peacocks
- ribbits of male frogs (females find this attractive)
- fighting with other males to obtain mates (emphasis  on large size, strength, and fighting structure rather than beauty)

==Natural selection is built step by step, nothing is planned beforehand by nature==

## Evolution and Genetics
---
Natural selection doesn't only affect an organism's traits, it also affects the **genes** of the offspring

Introducing genes into evolution described it as ***changes in the allele frequencies of genes over time**

Allele - variations of genes

Allele frequencies - how common different variations of genes are within a population

A moth population may have a light allele (a) and a dark allele (A) for their body colour, these frequencies can be represented by:
> 92% a and 8% A (there are far more light coloured moths than dark ones)

Overtime, as the population becomes more polluted with black moths, there will be a higher percentage of A types and a lower percentage of a's

This can be applied to natural selection by the same principle as the physical traits

Natural selection ***affects*** genes but it doesn't directly ***impact the genes*** 
> it impacts the physical traits and not the actual genome

This means that even if the dark moth population is more numerous, they still have trace amounts of the a allele, it's just that their A allele is more *dominant* and a allele is *recessive*
